<p>I'm wondering if there is anyone who is familiar with Swift and could help me revive the Swift UI example? </p>
<p>Basically we have <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/examples/swiftui">the Swift UI example</a> in the roc repository. But I haven't been able to get it working at all. </p>
<p>I have made a starter platform for Swift at <a href="https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-platform-template-swift">https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-platform-template-swift</a> </p>
<p>I think it would be nice to have a Swift UI example, and would love to upgrade the example platform.</p>
<p>I imagine for someone familiar with Swift this would be easy to do, just wiring up a hello world is all I think we need for now. I haven't learnt enough Swift yet to understand what I'm doing wrong, though managed to get the package working for <code>swift build</code>.</p>
