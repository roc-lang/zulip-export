<p>I have a question about the planed change, that allocators get passed.</p>
<p>With this change, it will be possible, that different calls to Roc could use different allocators. For example different buffers as pre allocated memory. This could introduce new kinds of memory bugs, when the memory of different values are in different buffers.</p>
<p>For example, if the platform uses a <code>Model</code>, like the <a href="https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-wasm4">wasm4-platform</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-ray">roc-ray</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>Model</code> could be a <code>List Str</code> (or a List of another refcounted type)  and the memory of each Str could be in a different memory buffer. What happens, if Roc tries to deallocate the list? Currently, it calls <code>roc_dealloc</code> for the list itself and for each element on the list. But since the elements could have been created with another allocator, <code>roc_dealloc</code> could not deallocate them.</p>
<p>How should we handle situations like this?</p>

<p>Should it be, that when you call Roc, all arguments have to be created with the same allocator?</p>

<p>Or would it be possible and enough, that allocators can not only be passed around, but also be <code>attached</code> to a type.</p>
<p>For example in zig, you have the <code>ArrayList</code>. Most of the time, it gets used like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Zig"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kr">var</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">list</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">ArrayList</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">u8</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">allocator</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">defer</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">list</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">deinit</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="k">try</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">list</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'H'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">try</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">list</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'e'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">try</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">list</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'l'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">try</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">list</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'l'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">try</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">list</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'o'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">try</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">list</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">appendSlice</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">" World!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So the allocator is saved with the array list, so each call to <code>append</code> and also to <code>deinit</code> use the same allocator. If we want to do this, all std-container-types (like List, Dict, Set etc) could use the allocator, they used, when they where created. But it would also be necessary, that when you add an element to a container, that was allocated with a different allocater, it gets copied to the allocator of the container.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is to update the <a href="https://github.com/ostcar/kingfisher">kingfisher</a> platform, to use an arena allocators for each request. So each request gets handled by its own allocator. But the Kingfisher-platform uses a <code>Model</code>, so parts of a request (a request-header or the request-body) could be saved in the <code>Model</code>.  Since the allocator of each request gets deallocated after the request finishes, Roc would need to make sure, that the memory used in the <code>Model</code> is copied to an allocator, that stays around for the hole runtime of the program.</p>
<p>Do you think, this could be possible in a future version of Roc?</p>

<p>and one of the operations we could expose is "clone" - where you pass it a roc_alloc (and it's potentially different from the one that was used to allocate the original value) and then it uses that roc_alloc for the new (cloned) value and everything inside it</p>

<p>Yeah, I have thought about this a bit and I'm not sure if it is better to have the roc types hold onto the allocator or have the platform guarantee the allocator is used correctly. My gut feeling is that the platform needs to be responsible and in control. If a roc list holds onto an allocator and the platform frees the underlying allocator, that roc list is now broken. So I don't think that really solves the problem</p>

<p>The idea to handle race conditions is, that the refcound of <code>Model</code> gets set to infinity for read-requests (Get-Requests) and that there can only be one write-request (POST) at the same time (One write requests OR many read requests).

<p>I don't think this will work. If your <code>Model</code> is something like <code>Model: {list: List Str}</code> and the application code does <code>newModel = {model &amp; list: List.append model.list "not a small string"}</code> then it is not a clone, but it has to be ensured, that the string and (if there is not enough capacity) the clone of the <code>List</code> gets allocated in the allocator of the model. This is not a clone of the <code>Model</code></p>

<p>I think the <code>clone</code> suggestion was that, <code>newModel = {model &amp; list: List.append model.list "not a small string"}</code> would be allocated into the request local arena allocator. On return from roc, the host would call <code>model.clone()</code> which would recursively clone the model into a different location to keep it alive longer.</p>

<p>Yeah, in current roc, you either need to fully understand the model data type to recursively set the refcount to constant or you need atomics.</p>

<p>In the current version, Roc exposes the function <code>handleWriteRequest : Request, Model -&gt; (Response, Model),</code>.</p>
<p>But I am playing with the API. One Idea is to have only one <code>handleRequest</code> function, but the http-method-type looks like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>RequestMethod : [
    Options,
    Get,
    Post SaveEvent,
    Put SaveEvent,
    Delete SaveEvent,
    Head,
    Trace,
    Connect,
    Patch SaveEvent,
]
</code></pre></div>
<p>And <code>SaveEvent</code> is an effect that updates the <code>Model</code>. So if you want to update the Model, you have to unpack the method with </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code> when request.method is
        Get -&gt;
           ...
        Post saveEvent -&gt;
            ...

<p>This uses Rocs type system, that you can only update the Model on write requests, but you don't have to update the model, if it did not change. For example, if there is a unauthenticated POST request. At the current version, the host can not know, if that <code>Model</code> changed and has to save it it any case. With the new API, it only needs to save it, when <code>SaveEvent</code> was called.</p>

<p>Anyway, how I see this playing out in practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>We get explicit allocators per requests not per container</li>
<li>We attempt to use them and figure out smart patterns that avoid any memory issues (probably add recursive clone for easy testing)</li>
<li>We evaluate if it is enough or if the allocator needs to be stored on each container type.</li>

<p>what can happen is that two different requests start getting handled in parallel, one increments a "total requests handled" counter in the model from 5 to 6, finishes, and saves the new model, then the other finishes and also increments "total requests handled" from 5 to 6 because it was 5 when both handler functions started running</p>

<p>SaveEvent could have a RWLock. So each request grabs a reader lock over the model. Only grab a writer lock with that function. Then mutate the model in place. Still have to be really careful. Cause either you need to lock the entire request or you need to ensure that no thread has a reference to any data within the model before freeing the lock.</p>

<p>There is a RWLock, but this lock is in the host. The host also checks the http method and only lets one write request through.</p>
<p>So there can not be a race condition on write requests, since there is no race.</p>
<p>I know that this has other problems. For example, you can send many unauthorized POST requests. But this limitation is fine for me</p>

<p>I read the topic, but I don't get it. </p>
<p>Would the Store/Actor be something, the platform provides which each call like <code>handleRequest : Request, Store a -&gt; (Response, Store a)</code>, or is it something that could life in some sort of global space in each Roc app and is therefore platform independent?</p>
<p>If it's the second case, then I would not need the kingfisher platform anymore. I could just use basic-webserver. All I want is a way to store state between requests. If this is something Roc can always do, it would be perfect.</p>
<p>But I think this global thing is not possible in a pure language, so you probably mean, that <code>Store/Actor</code> is something, the platform has to provide on each call.</p>
