<p>I am currently building a platform and the first point I need to decide is how to send data between the platform and app. My platform will provide an rpc! effect (among other things).</p>
<p>I am following the layout where I have a host folder with the golang code and a platform folder with the roc code in the platform project and then an app project that depends on the platform build.</p>
<p>My first idea was to put all the API types in the platform, however the issue with that was that I did not find a way where I can depend on the roc-json library from the platform.  So my next idea is to make a much smaller platform that just sends strings between platform and app and all the roc-json will happen in the app layer. </p>
<p>Is this the general approach or am I just missing how I can use roc-json in the platfrom? The platforms I have found so far are not using any third party roc modules afik.</p>

<p>This seems probably only semi-related to your obstacle, but FYI here's how I'm able to pass typed structs/records from/to my MIDI-centric platform: <a href="#narrow/stream/231634-beginners/topic/.E2.9C.94.20Memory.20layout.20for.20tags.20.26.20records">https://roc.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/231634-beginners/topic/.E2.9C.94.20Memory.20layout.20for.20tags.20.26.20records</a></p>

<p>Yeah, I'd recommend using json from the app for now.</p>
<p>The plan is to be able to import a package into a platform, but no one has implemented that yet.</p>
