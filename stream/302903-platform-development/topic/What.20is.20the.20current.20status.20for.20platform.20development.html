<p>I would like to try to make a Rust platform. Is this a good time to try or should I wait?. Are there any recent docs for how to go about making a platform other than looking at existing once?</p>

<p>We are planning some changes to platforms with the the new compiler but I'm not sure how big those will be <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="515757">@Luke Boswell</span> </p>

<p>No docs for this yet, <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-webserver">basic-webserver</a> and <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli">basic-cli</a> are probably the best examples for a rust platform.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="736800">@Henrik Larsson</span> you can build a rust platform today using the existing Roc compiler toolchain. If the goal is to experiment with ideas or build a proof of concept, and you're not looking to publish releases etc then I think that's ok. </p>
<p>There are definitely some oddeties and things to work around - but if you can fork an existing platform and make minor modifications you should be fine. I'm happy to assist a little -- though I've been really focussed on getting the new Zig compiler online. </p>
<p>We have solid examples in basic-cli, basic-webserver, basic-ssg, or my template <a href="https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-platform-template-rust">roc-platform-template-rust</a>. </p>
<p>Another approach that side-steps a lot of challenges is letting the cargo drive the linking etc (have Roc generate an object file). A good example is <a href="https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-ray">roc-ray</a>. I think this is a good option for now, it's not as nice an experience if your wanting to make a release to share with others.  </p>
<p>We intentionally haven't published any guides or documentation because the ABI and between the host and roc is a little different with our new compiler. We redesigned it based on our experience with the goal to have something much nicer.</p>
<p>If you are ok waiting a couple of months, I think after we've ported basic-cli etc to the new compiler we will have good examples, nice docs, and generally a much easier configuration for platform development. </p>
<p>So I'd say it's definitely possible to build nice Rust platforms today - but it requires fairly advanced Roc knowledge and systems level rust skills. </p>
<p>Let me know what you decide <span aria-label="smiley" class="emoji emoji-1f603" role="img" title="smiley">:smiley:</span></p>

<p>Awsome. Thanks for the info. I think I will just wait and keep an eye here for progress. What are the plans for the hot code reloading. Will this be a very development focused thing or will you be able to do hot code reload in production systems also?</p>

<p>We plan for the dev builds to run with an interpreter. So we should be able to make it automatically pick up changes with a flag if a user wants that.</p>

<p>I don't think there are any plans for a release build to do something similar</p>

<p>I think 95% of the design for hot code reloading is already implemented and in main. If you checkout the <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/test/int">Int test platform</a> that is working e2e. </p>
<p>For hot code reloading specifically ... I think** all that remains is to implement the part where the roc cli detects the file has changed using the watcher (which I think already exists??) and the rebuilds the ModuleEnv and restarts the child host-interpreter executable. </p>
<p>** I'm really fuzzy on how it's actually going to work</p>

<p>Maybe I'm getting confused with fast dev builds -- just rebuilding/restarting the app is currently like on the order of 10's of milliseconds.</p>

<p>We've thrown ideas around for something like roc-dom where instead of using inter-process communication you can stream the newly built app to a host running in the browser (for example) and then reload/restart. In theory it should be possible for the host to detect if the "Model" has changed and possibly re-use the old app state. </p>
