<p>Hello everyone. It's been a while since I used roc. So much progress has happened in the meanwhile. Nothing short of impressive. I was watching Richard's "Introduction to Roc Programming Language", and the http error (on the client side) is nothing short of impressive. However, coming from Elm decoders, I found it super strange that the HttpDecodingFailed does not have a payload with the actual error "Expected to find a string with name 'message'" or something. I am sure there is some technical decision/limitation behind this. I tried searching Zulip for "HttpDecodingFailed" but I didn't get a single hit (<span aria-label="interrobang" class="emoji emoji-2049" role="img" title="interrobang">:interrobang:</span>), so that is why I am asking here if the reason for the lack of payload is due to a technical limitation, of if this is something that has been planned for future versions of the API.</p>

<p>Iirc, there are plans to change the <code>Decode</code> and <code>Encode</code> abilities to allow for custom errors and stuff like that, so it will be possible in the future. Not sure though</p>
