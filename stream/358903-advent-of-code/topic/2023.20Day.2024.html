<p>I got both stars from day 24. But in the end, I can not say, that it is my solution: <a href="https://github.com/ostcar/aoc2023/blob/main/days/day24.roc">https://github.com/ostcar/aoc2023/blob/main/days/day24.roc</a></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time with day 24 and made so many detours. What I did was so dorky, that I don't use the spoiler tag. Nothing of it was necessary for day 24.</p>
<p>For the day, you have to work with fractional numbers. So first, I tried Dec. But Dec is not fully implemented yet. I don't remember which operation I was missing. Maybe it was <a href="#narrow/stream/231634-beginners/topic/Is.20sqrt.20implemented.3F">sqrt</a>.</p>
<p>Next, I tried F64. But you can not compare them. I understand the decision. But it it very hard to work with them. For example, it is hard to write a test. The following test is a type error:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="roc"><pre><span></span><code>expect
    f = 5.1 |&gt; Num.toF64
    f == 5.1
</code></pre></div>
<p>Maybe a <a href="#narrow/stream/231634-beginners/topic/things.20I.20cannot.20figure.20out.20on.20numbers">approx equal for Frac</a> would be helpful.</p>
<p>Next, I tried I tried to use a <a href="https://github.com/ostcar/aoc2023/blob/65e31325282014850ea5c775f382dbd7901fedc8/days/day24.roc#L339-L420">rational type</a> with some helper functions.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Rational a := (Int a, Int a)
    implements [
        Eq { isEq: qEq },
    ]

qEq = \@Rational (a, b), @Rational (c, d) -&gt;
    a * d == c * b

qAdd = \@Rational (a, b), @Rational (c, d) -&gt;
    @Rational (a * d + b * c, b * d)
    |&gt; qNormalize
</code></pre></div>
<p>This worked at the beginning. But it was very hard to make any calculations. For a type like <code>Rational</code>, it would be helpful to define infix function or overload operators.</p>
<p>For example, here is a calculation, I had to do.</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="roc"><pre><span></span><code>        # t1  = (a.x - a.y * b.x / b.y ) / (1 - b.x / b.y)
        t1 = qDiv (qSub a.x (qDiv (qMul a.y b.x) b.y)) (qSub (qFromInt 1) (qDiv b.x b.y))
</code></pre></div>
<p>I started with <code>Rational I64</code>, but the input has very high numbers. So I had to switch to I128. It seems, that there is a problem with I128 and the surgical linker.  The returned message is:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>An internal compiler expectation was broken.
This is definitely a compiler bug.

</code></pre></div>
<p>Using the legacy-linker fixed this for part1. But for part2 the numbers got even bigger and I could not use <code>Rational I128</code> anymore. Since I don't want (and probably are not able) to implement a <code>IBigNumber</code>,I used F64 in the end and it worked.</p>
<p>For the actual problem for part2, I spend many hours to make the calculation, but I was not able to solve the equations. In the end, I looked at other solutions and used the calculation from someone else.</p>

<p>Thanks for solving so many advent of code problems in Roc <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="496321">@Oskar Hahn</span>!<br>
I wish we could make faster progress on solving bugs but we have a bunch that are very difficult and time consuming to solve.</p>

<p>yeah I believe you now hold the record for most Advent of Code problems solved in Roc! <span aria-label="smiley" class="emoji emoji-1f603" role="img" title="smiley">:smiley:</span></p>

<p>Thanks. I am still missing 4 stars. Roc is so much fun. I is great to see it evolve. I hope, I find a hobby project I can do with roc until AoC 2024.</p>

<p>I hope you do too! And we'll be here to support, as always <span aria-label="smiley" class="emoji emoji-1f603" role="img" title="smiley">:smiley:</span></p>
