<p>I'd like to share a naive language server I wrote for Roc some time ago: <a href="https://github.com/ayazhafiz/roc/releases/tag/langsrv">https://github.com/ayazhafiz/roc/releases/tag/langsrv</a>. I do not intend it to be more featureful than what it already supports, as the main focus for Roc's editor support is the Roc editor. However, since that is still WIP, I hope this may be useful to anyone getting started with Roc who's looking for some help in their current editor along the way!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I only have access to a 12.6 aarch64 macOS machine, so that is the only prebuilt binary I can provide.I've left more instructions on building and using the language server in the release above, if you are interested in using this.</p>

<p>It was brought to my attention that the server isn't up to date with the builtins on the latest Roc nightlies. I've updated the <a href="https://github.com/ayazhafiz/roc/releases/tag/langsrv">release</a> to the latest version of Roc, and the arm64 macOS binary provided there.</p>
