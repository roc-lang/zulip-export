<p>After listening to you mention Serenity in the episode with Juan Vuletich on Cuis, I heard you mention not really knowing that much. One of the things I don't think you're aware of is that there's actually a programming language as part of the Serenity project as well, with the goal being to eventually replace C++ as the main language of implementation for the OS. I think a conversation between you and him would be really interesting.</p>
<p>Also, just wanted to add I've really been enjoying the podcast. You always seem to find great guests and interesting topics.</p>

<p>I actually assumed that Andreas had already been a guest on Software Unscripted, so I was surprised when I found out he hadn't <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span> I think I was thinking of an episode of the CoRecursive podcast. </p>
<p>I completely agree, SerenityOS/Ladybird are fascinating projects and Andreas is an excellent speaker <span aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f601" role="img" title="grinning face with smiling eyes">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span></p>

<p>I had the same thought. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of who has been on where :)</p>

<p>I'm a member of the Serenity discord server, but I've only been lurking there.</p>
