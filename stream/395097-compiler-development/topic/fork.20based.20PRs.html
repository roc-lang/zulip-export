<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="668714">nandi</span> what's different about the interpreter on the fork? Is it things you're looking to upstream, or is it specific to that project?</p>

<p>It's an amalgam of quick fixes I made for experimentation/bug fixes/etc. There's like 15 commits I rebase onto main after each pull. I need to go through and figure out whats trash and what can actually be a PR. It's just that I'm not a very good zig programmer yet and I don't really know the codebase so I'm kind of afraid of wasting people's time with slop</p>
<p>here's a link to my fork <a href="https://github.com/codegod100/roc/tree/dev">https://github.com/codegod100/roc/tree/dev</a></p>

<p>I had opus organize the commits I had into PRs and add snapshots. Hopefully it ended up being something useful</p>

<p>Breaking into separate commits looks helpful. Thank you for sharing this work. I've left some comments in the PRs. I think we have a few design discussions before we commit some of those. </p>
<p>I'm not sure on some things, and it's hard to keep up with the design sometimes, so we usually do the idea/proposal discussion first then implement. </p>
<p>But I also think it's cool to build cool things and then carve off parts that work into PR's -- as an exploration.</p>

<p>Yeah most if not all of these were created by me writing roc code and then having the agent patch the interpreter to get my code to compile rather than wanting specific things in the codebase</p>
