<p>I am gonna simplify the refcounting in roc. Initially, we made the max negative value be the lowest refcount. This is unnecessary and annoying for platform implementations.</p>
<p>Instead, I plan to switch things over to the more intuitive implementation. 0 is constant. 1 through n are refcounts 1 through n. If the first bit is set, it means that refcounting needs to be atomic.</p>
<p>As we realized a while back, with a 64bit refcount, it is impossible to roll over the refcount counter. Each references requires at least 64bits of memory. The machine is guaranteed to oom before running out of refcounts and rolling over the counter.</p>

<p>So instead of -max_int to -1. It is simply 1 to max_int.</p>

<p>As an extra note, still leaving anything atomic off. Though hopefully can eventually make it configurable in the platform. Maybe interesting to test with basic-webserver model eventually.</p>

<p>I continue to be amazed by how nice the m1 mac cache hierarchy and cpu is. For the nqueens benchmark (which basically spends all the time in allocating, refcounting, and freeing), here are the stats:</p>
<p>for apple m1.<br>
normal refcounting as baseline so 1.00x<br>
branch check for atomic, followed by normal refcount: 1.07x<br>
always atomic refcount: 1.27x</p>
<p>vs on my x86 linux machine.<br>
baseline still 1.00x<br>
branch check for atomic, followed by normal refcount: 1.15x<br>
always atomic refcount: 2.67x <span aria-label="poop" class="emoji emoji-1f4a9" role="img" title="poop">:poop:</span></p>
<p>There is no contention. This is a single threaded app. Yet always using atomic refcounts balloons the runtime to 2.67x.</p>
<p>Also, in raw execution speed, the m1 machine baseline runs just under 2x faster than the x86 linux baseline. The linux machine albeit a few years old, is a reasonable gaming machine with an i7.</p>

<p>Is using 0 as constant safe? If you have data with an refcount of 1, it gets reduced to 0. It seems error prone, that 0 is used for "never deallocate" and also for "should be deallocated".</p>

<p>If would also nice, that when the ref-count is set to "constant", that Roc will not write to the data or to the ref count. The effect would be, that you can call a Roc function with constant data in parallel without the need to to use atomic refcounts.</p>

<p>I think 0 is reasonable. All roc refcounting always checks the old value is 1 rather than if the new value is 0. That said, if you subtract first and then check the new value is 0, that still means you can deallocate it.</p>
<p>Due to 0 refcounts often being in read only memory you always have to early exit on 0 before doing anything else.</p>
<p>Also, for atomics, you only get the option to check the old value, not the new value.</p>

<p>Note: as long as all refcounts are set to constant correctly, you can already share data across multiple threads in roc without atomics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it enough to set the ref count of the most outer value to constant or does every referenced data needs a refcount of constant to be thread safe?</p>
<p>For example, if you have a type like <code>List Str</code>, for example <code>["not_a_short_str1"]</code>. And the app code does something like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>main : List Str -&gt; U64
main = \list -&gt;
  list
  |&gt; List.map Str.trim
  |&gt; List.len
</code></pre></div>
<p>would it be enough to set the refcount of the list to constant or would every element on the list needs a refcount of 0, so that Roc can be called in parallel without atomic refcounts?</p>
<p>I think, that all elements need a refcount of 0 for the call to be threadsafe. If this is true, would it be possible for roc to export a function like <code>set_refcount_with_references(data, n)</code> that sets the refcount of all elements in data to <code>n</code>? This would be especially useful, if the platform uses a generic <code>Model</code> and therefore does not know, what type the data is?</p>

<p>What is unsafe about that? They are all setting to the same value of <code>0</code>. So all threads will opt out of refcounting the data and never deallocate. Even if the location is written to 10 times, the value each thread sees is still <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>I guess if a platform mixes constants with atomics, we do have to be a bit more careful, but most likely that will be a platform bug. Anything set to constant should be threadlocal. And anything set to atomic should not be constant.</p>

<p>What do you mean, that a constant value has to be threadlocal?</p>
<p>I want to use a constant value over many threads. Will this be possible? The platform/host will make sure, that all of the parallel calls are only for reading. If a function is called, that wants to write the data, it first waits (with a RWLock), that all reading is done, then sets the refcount of the data to <code>1</code> and when Roc is finished, sets the refcount back to <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>Your proposal is, that 0 is constant, and when the highest bit is set to 1, it means atomic.</p>
<p>This is the same as saying, that positive numbers are non-atomic and negative numbers are atomic. With this explanation it is clear, that a constant value can never be atomic, since there is no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_zero">negative zero</a>.</p>

<p>I need to think about edge cases more. I initially was only thinking of propagating the atomic flag (which is always safe). It would also be nice to propagate the constants (just set a list to constant and its data on load will be set to constant). Propagating constants is only safe if the constant data contains no atomic data (aka only contains threadlocal data). Once set to constant, the data can be shared with any number of threads, but converting a list of atomic strings into a list of constants strings is not safe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to use a constant value over many threads. Will this be possible? The platform/host will make sure, that all of the parallel calls are only for reading. If a function is called, that wants to write the data, it first waits (with a RWLock), that all reading is done, then sets the refcount of the data to <code>1</code> and when Roc is finished, sets the refcount back to <code>0</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, I would just use atomic refcounting</p>

<p>with the RWLock still</p>

<p>I guess for safety of converting a list of atomic strings to a list of constants, I could not propagate the constant refcount unless the atomic is unique. That would be thread safe without pessimizing atomic refcounts elsewhere.</p>
