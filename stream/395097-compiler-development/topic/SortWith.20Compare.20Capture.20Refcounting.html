<p>With <code>List.sortWith</code>, we pass a compare function to zig. </p>
<p>The compare function could be capturing closure data. Which I think will actually be quite problematic.<br>
We theoretically need to increment the captures to that function for every time the sort function calls compare.<br>
Currently we just increment it for every element in the list.</p>
<p>To instead increment it for every call to the function, the only way would be to put the increment into the hot loop for sorting. I think that is a terrible idea.</p>
<p>I think we should either figure out a way to ban captures for the compare function or find a way to save and then reload the refcounts. Essentially, save the refcount, set the refcount to constant, run sort, set the refcount back to what it was originally.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Yeah, I guess this is a case where I should have zig generate two version of the code to also get the conditional out of the hot loop. Though the conditional would be 100% predictable, so maybe not a big deal.</p>

<p>One other related topic (that maybe we need to collect more data on before we decide), but we could technically have zig generate <code>n</code> different functions at comptime to dispatch across things like element width.</p>
<p>So code bloat that will be garbage collected by llvm for perf gains.</p>
<p>I think this makes solid sense for sorting cause after a certain element width it will become more economical to create a list of pointers and sort that instead of sorting the original list. So we just need to support element width up to that size.</p>
<p>I'm not sure the perf cost of an indirection to call the copy function (I'm also not sure if llvm may also be smart enough to realize the function is constant, propagate it down the call stack, and inline it), but from looking at the implementation for <code>fluxsort</code>, they mention that using indirection to call the compare function when sorting primitives like integers costs about 2x in terms of perf. Given copy is called more often than cmp, I would assume it has an even higher perf cost. Will definitely depend on whether or not llvm is smart enough to optimize it.</p>

<p>Also, I am thinking of porting <a href="https://github.com/scandum/blitsort/tree/main">blitsort</a> to zig as our new base sorting algorithm. It is very similar to glidesort overall (not quite inplace, quicksort mixed with other sorting algorithm to deal with bad cases), but simpler and written is very clean <code>c</code>. Also glidesort makes a number of rust specific tradeoffs to make it easier to support panic safety. I don't think panic safety is worth it (nor does the glidesort author really, costs 15 to 20% of perf). If a compare function in roc passed to a sorting algorithm panics, I think it is fine to just accept the list may be in a broken state.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <code>blitsort</code> and <code>glidesort</code> are both based off of <code>fluxsort</code> and seem to have very similar perf and default memory characteristics. <code>glidesort</code> theoretically can reach a higher speed on super new hardware with more execution and memory channels due to some interleaving, but that doesn't seem worth the complexity.</p>

<p>Also debated porting good old <code>timsort</code>, but it is significantly slower than <code>glidesort</code> and <code>blitsort</code> in many cases. For example, <code>glidesort</code> can be 2-4x faster than the standard rust sort (which is <code>timsort</code>).</p>

<p>Also, did a quick check of llvm ir, at least for the simple case of a short app that only sorts, it looks to be inlining the compare and copy functions.</p>

<p>A handful of it looks like it can be replaced with loops and labelled breaks.</p>
<p>Some of it looks like it will require move some code into a function.<br>
The function would be inlined in multiple places in the same wrapper function. So may lead to duplicate code if llvm doesn't realize it can merge the duplicate code blocks and insert jumps. Otherwise, if the functions don't inline, it is the cost of an extra function call in the middle of some code. So worst case, I think I would force inlining and llvm may duplicate some code, but that is probably fine.</p>
