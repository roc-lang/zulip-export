<p>Looking at <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="231634" href="/#narrow/stream/231634-beginners/topic/Help.20optimising.20my.20BF.20interpreter">#beginners &gt; Help optimising my BF interpreter</a> - a few things I think we should be able to address hopefully easily</p>
<ol>
<li>the tokinizer step compiles to a very poor if/else chain rather than a switch (<a href="https://gist.github.com/ayazhafiz/9669cbf36cf33001f794a0cab4db95f5">https://gist.github.com/ayazhafiz/9669cbf36cf33001f794a0cab4db95f5</a>). I think we should be able to eliminate the decs on constant strings here as well (<a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/5594">https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/5594</a>)</li>

<p>looking at the compilation of <code>run</code>: <a href="https://gist.github.com/ayazhafiz/edfb055da1082f8f42f352846222bd3e">https://gist.github.com/ayazhafiz/edfb055da1082f8f42f352846222bd3e</a><br>
I think we would benefit strongly from even naive LICM, escape analysis, and inline passes. If we inline List.get and run LICM we should be able to see that <code>Interpreter.221</code> can be hoisted outside the joinpoint, needs no inc, and the bounds check can be hoisted as well</p>

<p>The interpreter is currently written in an indirect-threaded/subroutine-threaded style rather than in a direct-threaded style.</p>
<p>Or at least the compiled code looks this way (every branch has its own call to <code>goToNextCommand</code>)</p>
<p>I wonder whether the performance of a version of the code where <code>goToNextCommand |&gt; run</code> is moved outside of the <code>when</code>is different or not. An inlining or duplicate code removal pass would do that automatically.</p>

<p>Folkert asked about the different ways blocks (the BF equivalent of loops) are implemented in various BF interpreters.<br>
I had to refresh my memory on it, but seems like the main two ways are (<a href="http://url">according to a brief skimming of RosettaCode</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>whenever a <code>[</code> is encountered and you need to skip to the <code>]</code>, read every next byte until the matching <code>]</code> is encountered at runtime and vice-versa (slow but simple)</li>
<li>do a pass over the program beforehand to build up a separate dictionary structure whose keys are the cells containing a <code>[</code> and whose values are the matching <code>]</code>. Jumping <code>[</code> to  <code>]</code> is done by looking in this dictionary. Keeping track of the <code>[</code> matching a <code>]</code> is even simpler because you're certain to have passed the matching <code>[</code> before, so you can add the location to a <code>[</code> on a stack and pop from this stack when you encounter a <code>]</code>. (little more involved, but much faster)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have not seen the technique of turning the BF AST into a tree before or elsewhere, though it is of course a very popular approach when interpreting any more complicated language :D</p>
