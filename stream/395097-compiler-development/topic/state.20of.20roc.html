<p>I have a high-level question -- what is the current state of roc? It seems that things have been in flux for a while, but with the updated module syntax and the <code>!</code> change complete, are we at a point where things may slow down and focus will return to stability and working towards a 0.1 release? i ask because there still seem to be a lot of seg faults and tooling issues (100% from lsp, for example) and i'm trying to understand how i should think about the current short term goals for the language. none of this is an issue, i'm just curious.</p>

<p>the core of the language feels like it's at a nice spot to me at this point, but i'm definitely not close to the development</p>

<p>I don't really have an answer, but I think a number of larger pieces would be wanted before a 0.1 release:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finishing the module params change</li>
<li>Effect interpreters (large platform interface change that I think is currently stuck on type system bugs)</li>
<li>Explicit allocators passed in from the platform </li>
<li>glue for at least rust being fully usable</li>
<li>Removal of <code>&lt;-</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some likely nice to haves:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fixing some performance sharp edges around refcounting and borrow inference.</li>
<li>Surgical linker fully working on all platforms</li>
<li>Dev backends fully complete and wired up (still missing a few minor pieces)</li>
</ol>
<p>Not sure which of these are true blockers or if I am missing anything, but definitely a solid bit still in flux. That said, most of these don't really effect the look and feel of roc as a language. Most of it is more around platform dev and completeness.</p>

<p>I'd love to track these issues down and make a milestone, I was thinking <code>0.1.0</code> or something. Would that be a bad idea?</p>

<p>personally I’m thinking about 0.1 as something we do when we think there’s enough benefit to justify it</p>
