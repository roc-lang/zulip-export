<p>It seems wise to include the AoC platform lukewilliamboswell/roc-platform-template-zig in roc-lang/roc for now so we can test it on every change and debugging is easier. Once things have stabilized more, we can split it off again. What do you think?</p>

<p>How would it be easier to debug? I'm probably biased because I've spent so long looking at it, but I find it easier being separate as there is much less to think about -- the boundary is much clearer. </p>
<p>I would rather keep it separate -- but dont feel strongly about it or anything.</p>

<p>When there is e.g. a segmentation fault in a roc app using the platform, I'm working with roc-src retrieved by ci/all_tests.sh. roc-src is not set up with an ssh clone, so I need to take extra steps to push the fix if the issue was in the roc source code. I also need to adjust my typical prompt for roc-lang/roc to tell it about roc-src.</p>
<p>Also if a change in roc-lang/roc breaks something in lukewilliamboswell/roc-platform-template-zig, it is likely not debugged by the the person who made that breaking change because all tests passed for them.</p>
