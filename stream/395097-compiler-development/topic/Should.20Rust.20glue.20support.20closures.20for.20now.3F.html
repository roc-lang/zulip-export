<p>My rewrite of RustGlue.roc is nearing feature parity with old Rust glue (only missing NullableUnwrapped tag unions and closures). I heard closures exposed to the platform are soon to become type-erased closures, which would simplify its glue code a lot (I'm not even sure the glue platform supplies enough information to correctly generate glue code for them at the moment). Would it be better to leave closures unimplemented for now until those changes hit?</p>

<p>Hm, I'm only finding talk of replacing lambda sets with erased closures entirely (before ayaz cracked lambda sets and that plan was reverted). Perhaps a misunderstanding on my part then</p>

<p>I don't think the glue revamp really affects this. At least not now. Long term, we will need to expose roc c abi functions to increase the refcounts of closure captures. I'm not sure if we need to expose anything to call the closure. Oh actually I think we plan to box the closures. That may actually simplify things and mean their refcounting works the same as box</p>

<p>I think type erasure would only be needed if we want many different shaped functions to fit in the same shaped hole.</p>
<p>I think this would be equally needed/equally not needed in the purity inference world.</p>
<p>We still want a map2 shaped solution to enable parallel execution (though I guess we could do a more raw thread style solution). Also, given results are not lazy like task, it definitely has to be shaped differently. For that to work, either we need type erasure, we need to box all the inputs and outputs, or we need to make the parallel executions all be <code>{} =&gt; {}</code> (only inputs are captures and outputs have to be through channels or some other mechanism).</p>

<p>I still kinda own type erasure, but I'm trying to prioritize the re-canning work for now. Once we have the new compiler pipeline at least mostly ready, I can coordinate with Ayaz to see how accurate the plan in his <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/rfcs/blob/main/0012-type-erasure.md">type erasure proposal</a> is for implementation, and then jump on that if we need it</p>

<p>It sounds like the current approach to exposing Roc closures to the platform will stay the same, at least for the foreseeable future? If so, I'll see if I can make any headway improving rust glue's support for them.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think it needs further discussion. Really depends how roc decides to support concurrency in the future. There are paths that don't need it, but it is unclear what path will be recommended.</p>
