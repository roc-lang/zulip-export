<p>After speaking with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="477725">@Jasper Woudenberg</span> , I decided to try and implement the Sort ability for floats. But quickly after starting, I realized there isn't a clear good way to do this. I made a list of strategies below, but was hoping to get some guidance from someone with expertise in the subject.</p>
<p>Strategies I am aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-prim-0.11.0/docs/src/GHC.Classes.html#compare">Haskell's</a>, implement compare in terms of <code>&lt;</code> and <code>==</code>, which always return false if either operand is a NaN. This resulted in compare always returning GT when there is a NaN involved. I am strongly apposed to this approach because, as the Haskell source code notes, this violates reflexivity which can result in data corruption.</li>
<li><a href="https://hg.openjdk.org/jdk/jdk13/file/1ddf9a99e4ad/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/Float.java">Java's</a>, if one or both operands are a NaN, do a raw bit comparison. If I understand correct, this will put all positive NaNs after positive infinity and all negative NaNs between positive and negative zero. I do not favor this approach because it puts the NaNs in two very different spots based on properties the vast majority of users will not care about. </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/5535e31a712343a63f5d7d796cd874e563e5ac14/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Double.cs#L260C13-L268C26">C#'s</a>, consider NaNs to be the smallest values. This strikes me as an acceptable approach.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html">Rust's</a>, define a partial order type which float is a member. We could define <code>PartialSort implements partialCompare: a, a -&gt; Result [LessThan, Equivalent, GreaterThan] [Unorderable]</code>. I like this approach because, a) it is honest about the fact that not all floats are comparable, and b), a PartialSort ability is likely useful for other types. I do not like that it will likely make working with floats more awkward.</li>
<li><a href="https://iremi.univ-reunion.fr/IMG/pdf/ieee-754-2008.pdf">IEEE-754-2008's totalOrder function</a>, this total ordering considers -NaN to be the smallest number and +Nan to be the greatest number. I do not favor this approach because it splits the NaNs based on a property most users do not care about. </li>
</ul>
<p>My instinct would be to go with the C# strategy and just make NaNs the smallest, though Rust's partial order approach strikes me as more in line with the Roc ethos.</p>
<p>Let me know what y'all think.</p>

<p>great question! We talked about this before: </p>
<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="281383">Richard Feldman</span> <a href="#narrow/stream/304641-ideas/topic/supporting.20NaN.2FInfinity.2F-Infinity.3F/near/275915943">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>so if we have a default <code>List.sort</code> for be floats, and a default <code>compare</code> for floats, and they both sort NaNs to the edge...what would be the situation where someone writes their own sorting algorithm using <code>&lt;</code> instead of <code>compare</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think what we want here is:</p>
<ul>
<li>all <code>NaN</code>s end up sorted to either the beginning or end</li>
<li>whatever comparison has the best performance, given that one constraint</li>
</ul>

<p>so I think C#'s approach makes sense, although it would also be fine to consider <code>NaN</code> to be the largest value (instead of the smallest) if it turns out that's better for performance than treating it as the smallest</p>

<p>I assume it's probably the same perf either way</p>

<p>I have another implementation question. Which of the two below options would be preferable from a performance perspective? I know a few more instructions can be preferable to branching, but I do not have a feel for how many instructions. <br>
a) A function with if-elses. This has a lot of branches, but the top two cases are the common ones. (I am guessing this does not actually need to be a function, but I am completely new to LLVM and compilers, so I would need some pointers on how to do that.)</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>float_sort(a, b)
    if a &lt; b
        return 2
    if a &gt; b
        return 1
    if a == b
        return 0
    if b == b  // a is NaN, so smaller
        return 2
    if a == a
        return 1
    return 0
</code></pre></div>
<p>b) This expression <code>(a == a) + 2*(b == b) - (a &lt; b) - 2*(a &gt; b) - 3*(a == b)</code>. This has no branches, but it is a lot of instructions. (It would also warrant a comment with a table demonstrating the logic)</p>

<p>Almost certainly branchless will be better for average performance. That said, the top implement <em>may</em> turn into cmovs anyway, though probably not due to returns. But if you assign that if back to a variable, probably would cmov and be quite good...though not fully sure.</p>

<p>Other way, I would bet on the expression being the better option</p>
