<p>To enter a newline in the CLI REPL we are using the sequence: ctrl-v + ctrl-j <br>
This feels unfamiliar and strange to me, I've never seen it anywhere else. But maybe it's familiar to other people.<br>
I used ctrl-Enter for the web REPL, because I've seen that in lots of places (including this Zulip chat window!)<br>
Does anyone know why we picked this sequence?<br>
Does anyone have opinions on it?<br>
Should we make both REPLs have the same sequence? Which one?</p>

<p>The strange Ctrl-v+Ctrl-J was partly due to <a href="https://github.com/kkawakam/rustyline/issues/653">https://github.com/kkawakam/rustyline/issues/653</a>.<br>
We do try to be smart about it, if you hit enter on an incomplete expression we create a new line instead of trying to pass it to the repl.<br>
But there still probably are cases where you have complete expression but still want a new line. Because of the linked issue we can't do Ctrl+Enter or Shift+Enter, but I think we could do Ctrl+n for example.</p>

<p>OK. That's a pity. The web doesn't have this issue though.<br>
So we can either use the same key combo as the CLI to be consistent with that. (Good for people who are very used to the CLI REPL)<br>
Or keep the ctrl-Enter to be consistent with... everything else. (Good for newcomers or Roc users who don't use the CLI REPL much)</p>

<p>I'd be ok with allowing two combos to do the same thing to get a best of both worlds :)</p>

<p>Cool, that's what I was thinking too. We already print out instructions in the CLI one and I'm going to add that to the web one too.</p>

<p>yeah having them be different makes sense to me! <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span></p>
