<p>I feel like at some point in the mid term, I am gonna want to get roc working on a few microcontrollers. The easier ones would be stm32s or esp32s (those are both arm/thumb or risc 5). Mostly should be a little toolchain setup. I also think I want to try to get roc on AVR chips (Arduino). Rust, c, and python all can run on Arduinos. So I bet roc can too. That said, it has more complex constraints, like being 8 bit with 16 or 24 bit pointers, more extreme memory constraints, and a much more early stages llvm pipeline.</p>

<p>I wonder if we should even bother with the small string optimization when pointers are 16-bit or smaller <span aria-label="thinking" class="emoji emoji-1f914" role="img" title="thinking">:thinking:</span></p>

<p>Probably wouldn't really hurt, but also wouldn't help often. Though short like 3 character codes are semi common in some robotics messages. That would still fit in a small string</p>
