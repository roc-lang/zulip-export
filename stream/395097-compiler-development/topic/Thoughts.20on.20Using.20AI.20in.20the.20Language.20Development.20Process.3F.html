<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’ve been following the development of the language over the past few years and recently noticed in some comments that a few of you are using AI tools (like Claude) during the development process. I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this.</p>
<p>What do you see as the main advantages, and what limitations or risks have you encountered (design choices, consistency, long-term maintainability, etc.)?</p>
<p>I’m genuinely curious to learn from your perspectives. Thanks in advance for sharing — and Merry Christmas <span aria-label="holiday tree" class="emoji emoji-1f384" role="img" title="holiday tree">:holiday_tree:</span>!</p>
<p>(Feel free to move this discussion out of “compiler development” if this isn’t the right place.)</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing!</p>
<p>I’m curious: do you find that the AI is able to maintain a sufficiently high-level, global understanding of the project on its own, or do you usually have to guide it quite explicitly (e.g. which parts of the codebase to touch, which files to modify, architectural constraints, etc.)?</p>
<p>In other words, how much of the “big picture” can you delegate to the AI today, and where do you still need to step in?</p>

<p>however for small bugfixes I actually can be like "hey Claude, here's a boilerplate script you can follow to reproduce the bug in a test, then track down the root cause, and apply a fix and then push a draft PR for me to review"</p>

<p>sometimes that's enough bc there's no "big picture understanding" necessary - just surrounding context clues like the bug report and Claude being able to poke around the code case is enough to figure out how to repro it and then find a fix (again, for small bugs!)</p>

<p>so usually the diffs for these PRs are very small and easy to review. I'd guess more than 50% don't need changes, but a common failure mode is "Claude made the test pass using a bandaid fix that doesn't actually address the root cause"</p>

<p>for bigger projects they need to be chopped up into smaller pieces, can't just be like "draw the owl of this whole feature" and there is usually way more iterating back and forth on my reviewing it, finding something unacceptable, describing the necessary revisions, etc</p>

<p>I also find it really valuable, I can contribute while working around other meetings and different things.

<p>One of my coworkers who is an extreme ai power users describes current AI as "a neurodivergent intern who is exceptionally passionate and types really really fast". I think that is a relatively fair way to describe it today. If you can give enough details, guidance, and measurable tasks, it can do great things. But it also can generate gigantic messes and releasing the enthusiasm without bounds is a catastrophic mistake.</p>

<p>I find for mych of my work, it requires very detailed prompting. Lots of asking targeted questions to get the AI to think about the problem in the right way and a lot of planning mode with thinking on and the "ultrathink" keyword. (This is for Claude opus 4.5)</p>

<p>Thank you for your answers, I find this workflow really impressive.</p>
<p>One concern I still have, though, is how well this approach holds up for building a programming language, where a lot of value comes from deep optimization, careful design trade-offs, and long-term refinement.</p>
<p>Do you feel the AI can meaningfully contribute at that level, or does it mostly help with implementation once those decisions are already very well defined?</p>

<p>so far I think the only way LLMs have contributed to Roc's design is in researching what other languages do - e.g. it's way faster now to say "hey <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat">Gemini</a> [which is the model I usually use for research] how do various different programming languages do _____?" than it used to be to try to find exactly the right part of documentation before, especially if I don't know what I'm searching for - e.g. one of my searches was "what names do different languages use for flat_map?" and if I do like "what does [specific language] call flat_map?" then if the language uses a different name, I had to hope someone asked a StackOverflow question like that or else I'd be running different searches guessing different names <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f604" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>I think this is still where the most value is. AI may be fast but understanding the depth to enable it to build robust and extensionable solutions is an important skill. Also for many areas of significant depth AI falls quite flat. So being someone who wants to dive deep and really grok things, you are in the best place to take advantage of AI.</p>

<p>I think the people who are getting hurt the most by AI right now are the people who are outsourcing too much to AI. As a result, they are no longer learning and growing. Instead they become stagnant and dependent.

<p>I think there is still demand for a programming language that:</p>
<ul>
<li>builds fast</li>
<li>tests fast: because it will not re-run tests whose behavior could not have changed</li>
<li>can easily work with access permissions</li>
<li>is easy to read by humans</li>
<li>encourages handling of a wide range of errors</li>
<li>is less likely to experience runtime problems because of static type checking</li>
</ul>
<p>It's actually an exciting opportunity to be able to make a programming language for this new age because we can design it with the capabilities of modern LLMs in mind. Making big changes like that seems a lot harder for established programming languages.</p>

<p>so in that world, like Anton noted, I think the "tests can be auto-skipped when they're all pure functions and the code didn't change" is a way bigger deal, because bigger test suites (currently) unavoidably slow the agents down, and yet are important for feedback loop reasons.</p>

<p>another example: the "what color is your function?" tradeoff of effectfulness needing to propagate all the way through a call chain - used to be a big downside because you'd need to do that propagation yourself. Now it's trivial; I'll just notice in the review that the agent did it.</p>

<p>I think it is the snapshot tests but also taken a level further. You need to make sure not only that you generate correct parsing/errors and what not, but also that you execute correctly. That is fundamental for programming language correctness. (I don't think snapshot tests run the interpretter, but maybe they do)</p>
<p>I think the theory being proposed here is that eventually I should be able to write a language implementation in python that covers all the errors and full intepretter setup. Build a conformance test suite that tests everything. Then ask AI to build me a fully working interpretter in Zig by implementing the tests one by one with a little extra guidance. After that I should theoretically even be able to ask for an llvm backend and just need to ask the ai to have it generate the exact same output as the intepretter when used.</p>

<p>I think this is the approach (or something similar) we're currently using building out the LLVM backend for Roc. </p>
<p>I am not sure how complete the LLVM backend is already, but from skim reading some of the PR's it looks like Richard has been using our tests with both the interpreter and LLVM backend and confirming they evaluate to the same thing -- and this being of the key methods of feedback for Claude and friends to work with as a source of truth.</p>

<p>I'm curious which Claude plan are you using when working on the Roc compiler? I'm new at AI coding, just tried Opus 4.5 today and found it promising. Unfortunately it was only able to write a few hundreds lines of code on an extremely well defined task (well documented, there's another implementation already in the same project etc.) before melting my pro plan quota.. It looks like the pro plan can maybe generate one PR/day at this rate. (or maybe I'm using it wrong?)</p>

<p>I've heard a lot of talk online recently that they really reduced the usage people get in the past few months. I signed up to the pro plan and was kind of shocked how quickly I ran out. <br>
Particularly when my github copilot plan which is cheaper (well actually free, thanks roc <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span>) gives me 100 prompts regardless of token usage.</p>
<p>I think github copilot makes or whatever they call it is basically the best deal around. It gives you like 500 prompts. Opus costs 3 prompts, but all other decent models are just one. </p>
<p>Github does give you only half the context limit though. I've also heard the Google sntigravity plan is also now a better deal than claude pro.<br>
(You can use all these providers inside opencode, and maybe zed or zed via ACP)</p>
<p>Lastly I actually tried exactly this, getting a totally fine coded attempt at adding compeltion to the roc language server...... It didn't go well. <br>
Probably didn't give it enough planning stages or whatever, but the result was just really cooked.<br>
It did manage to have completion of top level locals and builtins though.  But it was just kind of shitty and broke all the time.</p>
<p>I was thinking it might be easier to give it the existing rust lang server and tell it to replicate the architecture. The hard part is mostly the caching and the visitor.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I think I enjoy coding less, post AI, and that's a little sad. My motivation to tackle hard problems by hand and produce very high quality code in my free time is just so much lower when I know I can likely get the same result with less effort using AI. </p>
