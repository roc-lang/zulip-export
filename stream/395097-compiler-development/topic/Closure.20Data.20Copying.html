<p>At some point we need to really investigate closure data copying in Roc. Especially to compare it to either a manual implementation in c/zig or to compare it to rust async (or similar).</p>
<p>I am still kinda stunned that in an example like rocci-bird, essentially all of the code size seems to come from simply copying data from one closure to the next. Which probably also means that a significant portion of the runtime is just copying data between closures.</p>
<p>It fundamentally feels off to me. Maybe we are simply generating in a way that llvm can't optimize. May we need to unify our closure captures different to reduce data movement. I'm really not sure, but this really feels off to me.</p>

<p>I don't think that's the issue.</p>
<p>I think the issue is that essentially every new await captures slightly different data (cause new local variables). Instead of having space and just adding the single new variable to the closure capture, we create a totally new closure capture with a slightly different layout.</p>
<p>So like</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>state = SomeBigRecord

# captures {state}
clickedMouse = getMouse!

# captures {state, clickedMouse}
pressedW = getKey! &#39;w&#39;

activateAbility = calc state pressedW

if clickedMouse &amp;&amp; activateAbility then
    # captures {state, activateAbility}
    changeColorPalette!

nextState =
    if activateAbility then
        # something that uses state ...
    else
        # something that uses state ...

# captures {nextState}
displayState! nextState

Task.ok nextState
</code></pre></div>
<p>Optimally, this would be one shared closure capture. It would have enough space for everything and state would never move around.</p>
<p>Instead we make 4 unique closure captures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Store state into first</li>
<li>Load state from first and store into second</li>
<li>Store clickedMouse into second</li>
<li>Load state from second store into third</li>
<li>Store activateAbility into third</li>
<li>Store nextState into forth</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Tons of copying and data movement</p>

<p>not saying we should do this, but if we had nested closures capture strictly more as they got more and more nested, then: </p>
<ul>
<li>the capture itself would be bigger</li>
<li>much less copying would happen</li>

<p>Due to each cluster capture being is own alloca and everything being nested, I think we also have all 4 closure captures alive for a really long time(so much more memory use than sharing even in the naive way).</p>

<p>I don't know how hard of a problem that is to automate (seems like the type of thing where there's an off-the-shelf algorithm somewhere which optimizes it) but it could be a helpful exercise to try to find a manual organization of the rocci bird captures that would minimize copying and memory usage</p>

<p>In current roc, llvm often manages to inline these chains, but still creates a state for every single closure and copies around tons of data.</p>

<p>There are a couple ideas to resolve this that would likely work well.<br>
One is to more aggressively specialize unique lambdas to the same type. Part of the issue is that lambda sets monomorphize very aggressively, so two closures may have similar (but not the same) layouts, and be forced into different types. This can be seen for example with nested <code>Task.await</code> calls, where each nested <code>Task.await</code> is a separate closure. It may be better to force all nested calls to be the same closure type.</p>

<p>Another is to store closures that are additive as a linked list. If you indicate in the closure type the name of a symbol that the closure references (which is already done, at least at the type-checking level), you can avoid unpacking and repacking closure sets by instead representing each closure set as a linked list of records. When you need to add new data, append to the linked list. This used to be an approach for closure compilation, though I don't know how popular it is today.</p>
