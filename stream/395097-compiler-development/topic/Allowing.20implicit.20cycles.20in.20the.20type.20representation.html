<p>I don't know if this would fix some of our woes with recursive types or not, but I've been thinking about our representation, which tries to convert implicit type cycles into explicit type cycles (ie a transformation from equirecursive to isorecursive types in the literature). Dealing with isorecursive types in printing types/generating code is super useful, but I also wonder if the source of most of our problems is because of that transformation</p>

<p>What we could do instead is go full-in on the implicit cyclic representations. So, we would get rid of any explicit <code>occurs</code> checks, and always unify types when we begin to compare them (this is safe because our checker is non-backtracking), rather than after the point we determine that they are equivalent (as we currently do)</p>

<p>Code-generation of layouts also becomes more difficult, but the layout-interner operates on type variables anyway, so it should automatically cache layouts of the implicit recursion points (though, at that point, we would explicitly need to insert a recursion pointer in the memory layout, so this is a bit tricky)</p>

<p>because it might mean we don't end up needing to do that after all, but even if not—if it works, I suspect it'll improve both the code base and performance anyway, so we'll be glad to have it and can then proceed boxing closures anyway</p>

<p>well, I don't actually know if this works, it's just a thought. And we have a few other problems with lambda sets that are unrelated to recursive types specifically. So I'm not sure - if someone has the opportunity to spike it out, definitely useful though</p>

<p>I really want to figure out how to make this work. Here's a request for help. Consider we have the following function</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>mapper = \l, f -&gt; when l is
  Nil -&gt; Nil
  Cons x xs -&gt; Cons (f x) (mapper xs f)
</code></pre></div>
<p>It's clear that the inferred type for <code>l</code> is <code>&lt;t&gt; = [Nil, Cons a &lt;t&gt;]</code>. Now, the question is, can we find an algorithm that can efficiently "see" that <code>&lt;t&gt;</code> is recursive during or right after inference?</p>
<p>As is it, the unification would proceed as</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>l = tvar_0 (tvar = type variable)
l ~ Nil = [Nil]a
l ~ Cons x xs = [Nil, Cons a b]c; xs has type c
mapper xs f =&gt; typeof&lt;xs&gt; = typeof&lt;l&gt; =&gt; c = typeof&lt;l&gt;
=&gt; typeof&lt;l&gt; = [Nil, Cons a b]&lt;typeof l&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>But we don't yet explicitly see that &lt;typeof l&gt; is recursive in itself. The obvious solution is to perform an occurs check at this point, but this is not efficient.</p>
<p>Can we do this efficiently?</p>

<p>some ideas from GPT-4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Structure Sharing in Unification: By employing structure sharing in the unification algorithm, you can avoid redundant traversals of type structures. When two type variables unify, they can share the same structure, reducing the need for repeated checks.<br>
   Efficient Occurs Check: Implementing an efficient occurs check can significantly improve performance. This could involve optimizations such as:<br>
       Path Compression: During unification, flatten the structure of type variables to minimize the depth of the tree.<br>
       Tail Recursion Optimization: Make the occurs check tail-recursive if possible, to reduce stack usage.<br>
   Incremental Unification: Instead of performing a full unification pass at every step, you can incrementally update the type information as you traverse the structure. This reduces the overall computational load.<br>
   Caching Results: Cache intermediate results during unification and type checking. If you encounter a type structure you've already processed, you can reuse the cached results instead of recomputing.<br>
   Detecting Recursion Early: Analyze the structure of the function and its parameters to identify potential recursion early in the process. For instance, in your example, the recursive call to mapper within itself is a strong hint of recursive types.<br>
   Graph-based Representations: Representing types as graphs rather than as tree structures can make it easier to detect cycles (indicative of recursion) efficiently.<br>
   Lazy Evaluation: In some cases, using lazy evaluation strategies in your type inference algorithm can defer processing until necessary, reducing immediate computational overhead.</p>

<p>I think it's helpful to work out of this example, just based on first principles.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>mapper = \l, f -&gt; when l is
  Nil -&gt; Nil
  Cons x xs -&gt; Cons (f x) (mapper xs f)
</code></pre></div>
<p>In more detail, let's consider what it takes to infer the type of <code>l</code> here.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>1. `l` is introduced. Give it some type variable `v1`.
2. We encounter `Nil` and `Cons x xs` matched against `l`. Suppose typeof&lt;Nil&gt; = [Nil] and typeof&lt;Cons x xs&gt; = [Cons v2 v3]. Then we set v1 = [Nil, Cons v2 v3]
3. We encounter `mapper xs f`. This induces the constraint `v3 = v1`. So now we have v1 = [Nil, Cons v2 v1].
</code></pre></div>
<p>This type is correct but what we'd like is to note at that point that we should store somewhere (e.g. a lookaside table) that v1 is recursive in itself</p>

<p>Is what we currently do, but only for tag unions. And it's half baked. So we could add it to more places but i'm not sure that scales. For example, we 'd need to also add it to be able to infer something like <code>X : (Str, List X)</code> as recursive properly. And I'm sure there are more cases like this.</p>

<p>Because consider for example we have that mapper function, but it's a more complex type <code>[Cons a {x: b}, Nil]</code>, and we need to specialize it twice. The first time we specialize it, it's because it's called with a type <code>b = [Cons a {x : b}, Nil]</code>.  But the second time we specialize it, it's because it's called with a type that had the determined recursion point in a different place, like <code>c = [Cons a (c = {x: b}), Nil]</code>. Since the specialization of <code>mapper</code> is determined by the caller, and the callers can be disjoint from each other, we can't adjust this.</p>
<p>This is the advantage of finding the recursion points up-front. If we found the recursion point in the generalized <code>mapper</code> definition, then each specialization would also inherit that recursion point during unification.</p>

<p>FWIW I think polymorphic variants are usually used pretty sparingly in OCaml code. The general wisdom is that polymorphic variants produce less efficient compiled code.

<p>I'm pretty sure this is a non-problem for OCaml. Inference of recursive types is not really the issue (that part is easy, just eagerly unify all types you compared). Figuring out where recursive types "are recursive" is the problem, and OCaml doesn't have that issue because it boxes ~everything (so codegen doesn't need to care about where the point of recursion happens). At least that's my understanding</p>

<p>here's an idea: what if during unification we record in <code>Content</code> whether a type is concrete? That should be super cheap.</p>
<p>Then we do an <code>occurs</code> check except it short-circuits on concrete types because we know they're either not recursive or else they're nominal and therefore we already know where they recurse</p>

<p>so what if we started with this, and then whenever we detect a recursion point during specialization, we go look up the name of the function we're specializing, look up its unspecializd type and canonical IR, and then do a check of that whole function looking for recursion points and writing them down in subs.</p>
<p>That way, if any future specializations run into this, they will all use the same one.</p>

<p>the theory would be that this wouldn't come up often in practice, so doing extra work (but only 1 extra pass per recursion point, not N of them) would be fine in practice</p>

<p>I'm not sure that this gets us much. Like, if there are specializations that force the recursion point to occur in a different place, then we still require another specialization - and now we may have two places in the type that we need to Box, instead of just one</p>

<p>But I agree we should do this. More specializations has only the downside of more code to generate, and you can bound the number of specializations by using an explicit type annotation</p>
