<p>Is anyone interested in taking over work on inspect? I currently have defined all of the userland types and proved it can work, but have not done anything on the compiler side:</p>
<ul>
<li>add a built-in module</li>
<li>add auto derive code (might need some special work around due to all types always having inspect. So opaque types have a default inspect that then can override)</li>
<li>integrate with <code>dbg</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I think my time is going to be more scattered for a bit and I think it will be more valuable for me to either work on smaller things and/or things that I have a much better understanding of.</p>

<p>Also, I guess I could post this in contributing, but not sure how easy/hard it would be for a newer contributor.</p>

<p>I think the head tasks (adding the built-in module, performing type inference + obligation checking in the front-end) are relatively straightforward. The auto-derivers and getting <code>dbg</code> to work with this are harder, but I am happy to mentor or guide anyone interested. We also have a bunch of well-scoped PRs for previous efforts in this space (<a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/4195">https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/4195</a>, <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/4202">https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/4202</a>)</p>

<p>For anyone interested, my current work is on the <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/inspect-testing">inspect-testing</a> branch. This <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/inspect-testing/examples/Inspect.roc">Inspect.roc</a> should essentially match the final file that will be added to the builtins. There  is also <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/inspect-testing/examples/LogFormatter.roc">LogFormatter.roc</a> which is probably pretty close to the output we want for <code>dbg</code> to use (though maybe it will want some color or other minor formatting changes).</p>

<p>I think <code>dbg</code> might not be that hard because it can be very similar to <code>roc_alloc</code> (except <code>roc_dbg</code>) - so there's something very similar already in the code base</p>

<p>I think the tricky thing with dbg will be special-casing the ability resolution and injecting the appropriate calls to the specialized inspect during code generation</p>

<p>We just have the userland code I linked above. It works, but is far from all the work listed in this thread. Yeah, probably should cross post to see if anyone is interested.</p>

<p>I think we should bump priority on this - not only would having <code>Inspect</code> + <code>roc_dbg</code> (and maybe <code>roc_expect</code>? <span aria-label="thinking" class="emoji emoji-1f914" role="img" title="thinking">:thinking:</span>) fix issues like <span aria-label="point up" class="emoji emoji-1f446" role="img" title="point up">:point_up:</span> , it would also mean that <code>expect</code> and <code>dbg</code> would immediately Just Work on Windows, which would unblock Windows nightlies</p>
<p>in the Detroit Tech Watch Q&amp;A last week, someone was saying "I'm interested in Roc but can't use it because I'm on Windows" - which I realized is currently true for anyone who doesn't want to build from source, since we don't have Windows nightlies (due to their being blocked on <code>expect</code> and <code>dbg</code>, which Inspect would unblock)</p>
