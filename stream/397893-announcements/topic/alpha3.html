<p><a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/releases/tag/alpha3-rolling">Roc alpha3 is out</a>. It mainly solves some macos issues. There are no new features because we're working on a clean <a href="https://gist.github.com/rtfeldman/77fb430ee57b42f5f2ca973a3992532f">rewrite of the compiler in zig</a> that aims to be reliable and easy to maintain :)</p>
<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Both macos releases are now built with macos 13 so they may no longer work on macos 12.</li>
<li>old_linux releases are gone, they were built with really outdated software at this point.</li>
<li><code>0-</code> was removed from the filename of the tar.gz archives.</li>
<li><code>0.0.0-</code> was removed from the tag name; it is now <code>alpha3-rolling</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The roc binaries built for macos no longer require the z3 dependency. <code>brew install zstd</code> should be all that is required.</li>
</ul>
