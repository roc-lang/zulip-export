<p>By numbers parsing, you mean conversion to binary? I'd be a little hesitant about that specifically because it loses information about how the number was written - e.g. hex vs decimal. That's critical for formatting, at at least possibly useful for better error messages in some contexts. Lastly, it's extra work that the tokenizer doesn't really need to do (i.e. can be done later instead, and isn't needed by all downstream consumers of tokens).</p>

<p>I agree operating on things in cache is important, but I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281383">@Richard Feldman</span> is over-indexing on that. One of the things that makes SIMDJson fast is delaying a bunch of processing until later when it's actually needed - even if that means reloading that from cache.</p>

<p>Carbon-lang, which has some very ambitious perf targets, copies out numbers and such to separate bufferes during tokenization (lexing), but doesn't do the actual conversion to binary until later.</p>

<p>Also, extra is IMO currently too large and needs to be trimmed down. Trying to store parsed 64-bit (or 128-bit!) values there will significantly increase memory usage and maybe even slow other things down.</p>

<p>At a minimum, this processing should be separable / configurable, perhaps via an interface (anytype?) passed to the tokenizer with a no-op impl we can use for the formatter. And I would do everything we can to not add to <code>extra</code></p>

<p>I think you are likely accurate about most of this. Especially given individual hot loops especially that stay in Simd are very powerful. It is important to remember that a branch miss can often be much worse than a cache miss.</p>

<p>the specific reason that the paper talks about for SIMDjson's speed is avoiding branch mispredictions</p>
<p>let's say I want to not do any processing and instead just store the number <code>12345</code> in a side table (like Carbon apparently does). what <em>specifically</em> happens to store those bytes in a side table?</p>
<p>we iterate through the digits in a <code>for</code> loop until we hit the end of the sequence, each time copying a byte over. there is 1 branch misprediction, at the end of the loop, when we hit the end.</p>
<p>suppose instead that I am processing <code>12345</code> from a string into an <code>u64</code> and then putting that in a side table. what does the CPU do differently?</p>
<p>again, it iterates through each digit, does some extra arithmetic (no impact on branch predictions and essentially free), then at the end of the loop, hits the same 1 branch misprediction because we hit the end of the digits, and then copies the u64 into the target side table, which does not involve branching</p>

<p>so if the reason SIMDjson is fast is (as the paper says) because it minimizes branch mispredictions, and processing the digits into u64 involves the exact same number of branch mispredictions (namely, 1) as copying it into a side table instead...where specifically is the anticipated slowdown coming from?</p>

<p>There are multiple other possible effects here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Depending on tooling setup/etc, tokenization can easily happen much more frequently than canonicalization, because of things like format-on-save and possible later optimizations like (in a language server) realizing that all the tokens are the same and so we don't need to re-run the parser or canonicalization/etc.</li>
<li>You might cache miss _regardless_ in that later stage. Perhaps not on that exact memory load, but on an independent/neighboring one effectively covers this one.</li>
<li>You're also paying a cost to copy this information around thru the parser, can, etc - none of which it's relevant for. Neither the parser nor Can need to known the value of an int/string/etc to do their job. An extra 64-bit value in the parse tree is a non-trivial extra bit of data to store and copy, when multiplied by a large number of tokens. In contrast, basically everything needs to keep the range around for error reporting, so if we just use that it's free.</li>

<p>Ah, interesting. Why do that in Can rather than after type checking? I assume you have to re-do that after type checking _anyway_, to handle cases where type checking refined the type to e.g. a U8 or whatever.</p>

<p><code>Frac</code> means one of <code>F32</code>, <code>F64</code>, or <code>Dec</code></p>
<p>(<code>Dec</code> is fixed-point, not floating-point, so the name "float" doesn't accurately describe it)</p>

<p>I don't feel good about replacing region info with numeric data in <code>extra</code>. the other options are always pushing this data to a separate collection (as with interned), or extending token size which of course is a terrible idea.</p>
