<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/pull/4280">#4280</a> to see what it would be like to have the builtins injected alongside a package for docs generation. My rust is basic, but I managed to hack something together that seems to work. Please let me know if this is a feature  we would like to have. If it's not quite right and someone can outline the changes required, I would like to try and  get it working.</p>
