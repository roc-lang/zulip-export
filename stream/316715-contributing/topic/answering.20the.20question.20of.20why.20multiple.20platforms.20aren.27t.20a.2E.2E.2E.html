<p>I think my conceptual model for why only one platform is the effect interpreter.  The effect interpreter is like "the" runtime that executes my application, but because Roc is statically compiled it all happens at build and gets detangled into a highly optimised executable.</p>

<p>What's the question behind the question? I'm guessing it's "Am I locked into a plattform?"</p>
<p>With only superficial of Roc, I assume the answer is technically yes, but practically no. Roc probably makes it pretty easy to factor out the code that can be shared between platforms, so that you can practically run the same app on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Just to throw in another metaphor (I don't think it's good): Your app is some electric device and the platform is a power socket. You can only plug your device into one socket at a time. But on vacation you can put an adapter in between, so that you can connect it to differently shaped power sockets.</p>
<p>This metaphor can actually be extended to explain that this only makes sense for compatible platforms. For example it's generally nonsensical to write an app for a CLI and expect the same app to work as a web server. Even with an adapter, it doesn't make sense to connect a normal device to a high power socket.</p>

<p>On the mental model I second Luke. The platform provides you with a set of instructions you can use, you give it back something in those instructions and it then does them according to your app.</p>
<p>Since these instructions come from the platform, you can't generally switch out the platforms. But you can write an app and then translate between similar instruction sets and therefore platforms.</p>

<p>An answer to that can be that platforms should expose high-level effects for their niche, but have the “more general” effects like File I/O and networking remain low-level such that the specifics can be implemented in platform-agnostic packages</p>

<p>It wasn't long ago that I had this exact question and it felt so concerning to me that I would be locked into a particlar platform. Like I feel like my code should be transferrable and I should be able to use everywhere. The platform / app abstraction actually supports this really well in Roc, but before I understood what it actually was and how it workd that was a serious concern I had. </p>
<p>One thing that helped me was seeing how in VDOM there is essentially 1 "app" that is made from two different platforms to make the front end (in JS with wasm) and backend server parts. I wouldn't expect anyone to dig as deep as I have to see how you can make it work so easily.</p>
<p>So one Idea I have that I've been toying with is making an Advent of Code template that actually has multiple apps that all use the same code. Its not a package or anything, but literally I can run <code>roc run aoc-cli.roc -- day1</code> or something and then also run be able to run <code>roc run aoc-web.roc</code> and it Just Works. This would show how you can structure your code with Modules and types that make it easy to share across platforms.</p>
<p>The other part I was confused about was cross-platform libraries. Like I was concerned that I would write e.g. PostgreSQL and it would only work on 1 platform. But with the design for platforms to expose low level primitives that package authors then build on top of, that wont be an issue. Unfortunately, without the Module params stuff this is harder to show people.</p>

<p>I think this will be a lot cleaner when we have the new way to pass around effect functions and import them. Cause then we can define a primitive base that can be shared between multiple platforms. Until then, there is no guarantee that two platforms will have supporting primitives.</p>
