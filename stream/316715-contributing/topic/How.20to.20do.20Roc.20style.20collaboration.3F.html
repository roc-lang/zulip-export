<p>I'm interested to know if anyone has experience they could share about methods of collaborating on concepts/design etc remotely? </p>
<p>I have been thinking about the "what" and "why" of a plugin; and I'm trying to use a concrete example to explore ideas. My current thoughts are to write things down in a gist, and then share with the community here in Zulip looking for critical feedback. Is there a better way to do this?</p>
<p>I know my understanding of some parts of Roc and FP are very limited at the moment, and I'm not really polishing things; however I figure it's better to get something down and then we can iterate as a community from there. I hope for anyone who wants, to be able to participate and join in the fun.</p>

<p>For rbt, we have architectural decision records (ADRs). That works ok but means you need to have at least some idea of where they should live. GitHub’s PR review tools make this nice</p>
