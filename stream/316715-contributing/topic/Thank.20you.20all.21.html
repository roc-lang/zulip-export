<p>So it's Thanksgiving in the US, and every Thanksgiving since I've started Roc, I've always felt thankful for Roc's contributors. I really appreciate all of you!</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, the way all I/O in Roc was done was using backpassing and Tasks on a single thread, and the only GUI applications we'd ever had were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnbKVTO0eUE&amp;t=710s">cool, but minimal</a>. Lambda set bugs were a known issue but there was no known solution.</p>
<div class="youtube-video message_inline_image"><a data-id="XnbKVTO0eUE" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnbKVTO0eUE&amp;t=710s"><img src="https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/f081fc98e0e8fa7b921cc36afebdb823be8d7f70/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f586e624b56544f306555452f64656661756c742e6a7067"></a></div><p>So much has changed! As of today, Roc has gained purity inference (no Tasks needed) - which we only knew would be worth trying because of the resounding popularity of the <code>!</code> suffix - as well as a <a href="https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-ray">much more fully-featured native GUI platform</a>, a proof-of-concept Action-State platform running in the browser, and even a working <a href="https://github.com/bhansconnect/roc-coro-webserver">proof-of-concept of coroutine-based concurrent I/O</a> where you don't even need to do async/await, promises/futures/tasks, etc. We also got <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/pull/7173"><code>return</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/pull/7193"><code>try</code></a>, and even have a <a href="https://github.com/ayazhafiz/cor/tree/b67174d98b6dde16809b3606f9f88d4863d8743f/experiments/lss">proof-of-concept fix for lambda sets</a> and <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/pull/7243">progress on implementing a real fix!</a></p>
<p>This isn't even all the awesome stuff that's happened in the past year, and all of it has been thanks to all of you amazing contributors. I really, really appreciate you! It's been great to see new people landing awesome improvements, and absolutely heartwarming to see experienced contributors mentoring and supporting the new folks.</p>
<p>I'm smiling as I write this. It's so great to have such a wonderful community, and such great contributors! Thank you all. <span aria-label="heart" class="emoji emoji-2764" role="img" title="heart">:heart:</span></p>

<p>My life has been made better by being able to spend my free time with a smart group of people trying to make development better for everyone. Thanks all!</p>
