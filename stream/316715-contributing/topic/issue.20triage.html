<p>Thanks Richard, my pleasure <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> . <br>
Most of the issues I helped closing were reproducible with small code samples. But a lot of issues are very difficult to reproduce. Especially in Roc's case where there is a platform dependency, and that platform has since changed, so a lot of problems are practically not reproducible anymore. The only person who is in the best position and perhaps would want to invest the time needed to see if it is solved is probably the issue's author. <br>
I think it is the issue's originators responsibility to 'weed out' their issues. Although it is very common to see issue's lists of upcoming languages grow out of hand (I look for example at you Julia: 3800 issues / Go: 5000+ / Rust:  5000+), I think Roc should try not to follow in their footsteps. I know it is difficult because of platforms and high rate of development, but issue authors should make a deliberate effort to comb through their issues, and close the ones that are not relevant anymore. This will surely enhance Roc's professional outlook to the world, an out-of-hand growing issue list on the other hand signals too much instability/immatureness.</p>

<p>I've made a note to check the issues I authored :)</p>

<p>Would it be useful to have one of those bots that comments on an issue after a few months of inactivity? To be honest, I always found them annoying, especially when they automatically close issues, but maybe if it was opt in by tagging an issue as something we want to periodically be reminded to check?</p>

<p>we have one set up, but it doesn't seem to work right. I haven't investigated what's wrong with it, but if anyone is interested in figuring that out, I'd a appreciate it!</p>
