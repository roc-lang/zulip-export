<p>I believe we used to have a repl prompt symbol like <code>»</code> in our tutorial, but it's gone:<br>

Anybody know what might have happened?</p>

<p>Seems like something must've changed with how the <code>repl-prompt</code> class gets handled <span aria-label="thinking" class="emoji emoji-1f914" role="img" title="thinking">:thinking:</span>.</p>
<p>Based on snapshots from the Internet Archive, the most recently working version was from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231101060539/roc-lang.org/tutorial">Nov 01, 2023</a>. The following snapshot is from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231122075243/roc-lang.org/tutorial">Nov 22, 2023</a> and the prompt is not present there.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/compare/6624abf93..57f7a79a5">This</a> is the entire diff between the two dates. For instance, there appears to have occurred a migration from an older version of the website to a WIP version of the website, and the discrepancy might've occurred within that context, somewhere along the line.</p>
<p>There are a few suspicious changes which might've caused the discrepancy. I'll try to find some time tomorrow to do a bit more debugging. I'll try to iteratively build the tutorial for each commit in the aforementioned range and pinpoint the exact commit where the discrepancy occurred this way.</p>
<p>For reference, I think the code of the REPL prompt character (<code>»</code>) is <code>0xbb</code>, so it's possible that references to it might lead us to the culprit.</p>

<p>It seems to me it might be a matter of re-defining (as it seems it's been removed since in <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/commit/f7cd9422f63a3c31b612fe18f45c44e406568e4b">this</a> commit)</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="CSS"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">repl-prompt</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nd">before</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">color</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">--repl-prompt</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">content</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"» "</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>along with the <code>--repl-prompt: #0064ff;</code> colour as well. I've just tested this out in the Developer Tools in the browser and it seems to be working as expected.<br>
I'll raise a PR accordingly.</p>
<p>One possible caveat is that there seems to have used to be a TODO-like comment (removed together with the <code>.repl-prompt</code> CSS in the <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/commit/f7cd9422f63a3c31b612fe18f45c44e406568e4b">same</a> commit) saying</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="CSS"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">/* Add this using CSS so it isn't selectable, which would be annoying when trying to copy/paste! */</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>which was probably meant to be addressed before removing the prompt altogether. Alternatively, it <em>had been</em>, in fact, addressed but then it might've broken otherwise since then.</p>
<p>I've also tested this behaviour with the aforementioned Developer Tools tweak, and it seems that when code is copied, the prompt doesn't get copied alongside. The output does nevertheless, but I believe that's expected behaviour.</p>
<p>Any feedback regarding the direction in which we'd like to take this would be welcome! <span aria-label="pray" class="emoji emoji-1f64f" role="img" title="pray">:pray:</span></p>

<p>PR <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/pull/6713">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This re-adds the CSS corresponding to the REPL prompt in the tutorial section.</p>
<p>When code is copied, the prompt symbol (<code>»</code> ) doesn't get copied alongside the code, which matches the expected behaviour.</p>
<p>The behaviour has been tested by building the website locally and inspecting the output corresponding to the tutorial page.</p>
</blockquote>
