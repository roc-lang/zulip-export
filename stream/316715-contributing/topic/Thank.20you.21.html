<p>Today is Thanksgiving in the US, and as per tradition, I'm reflecting on things I'm thankful for.</p>
<p>Every year since others started contributing to Roc, I've felt thankful and fortunate to have great people helping make this project real.</p>
<p>Especially this year, after having just seen such a flood of positive reactions on Monday to everything we've been building here, it's really getting emotional for me thinking about it. All of that positivity is because of all of you. However exciting and impressive Roc's progress is, it's because of the people who made that progress happen.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, all of you, for making this language what it is. I really can't find the words to do justice to how grateful I feel that you've done what you have for Roc. I really, really appreciate it!</p>
