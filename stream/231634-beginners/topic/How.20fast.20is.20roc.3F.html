<p>How fast is roc? Can I use it for a game loop itself? Do I have to pass all data as values to the function, or is there a way for the platform to manage pointers that the roc code calls? Use case I'm thinking is that I could give the game state to every loop, but I imagine that copying the values down wouldn't be ideal. If I could read values out of a struct of arrays I imagine it could be fast, but I wondered how I would even be able to do that, would I need like, to implement like read(path, index) and then pass back/forward for each read? Maybe read(path, start, count) and return an array in some contexts? I worry that might be slow with all the extra functions, or maybe not? Maybe it's the kind of thing that a smart compiler could inline? I'd guess writing would have similar difficulties. Being lazy coder, I'd just want to pass a struct in at the start and then return a new /modified/the-same struct at bottom.</p>
<p>My understanding is that roc compiles down to be roughly as fast as any pure function in a statically compiled language, but there may be added overhead for certain scenarios like above where the need for 'effects' causes a larger amount of functions and deeper stacks to compensate for the overhead provided by the safety guarantees of roc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How fast is roc?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think in the same ballpark as go when used correctly. So quite fast but not the fastest possible thing due to memory management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can I use it for a game loop itself?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You definitely could.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do I have to pass all data as values to the function, or is there a way for the platform to manage pointers that the roc code calls?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could do either. You could pass in a record with all of the state (as long as the state is store in a roc friendly format (like using RocStr for string data). Or you could pass an opaque pointer and require roc to use an effect to extract the data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to implement like read(path, index) and then pass back/forward for each read? Maybe read(path, start, count) and return an array in some contexts?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, those would both be options.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I worry that might be slow with all the extra functions, or maybe not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cost will roughly be the same as calling a virtual function on a class in C++. So definitely not zero, but for most use cases, not something you need to worry about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being lazy coder, I'd just want to pass a struct in at the start and then return a new /modified/the-same struct at bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definitely doable if the platform can represent its state in Roc types. You may have to be a little careful around immutability semantics, but totally should be workable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that roc compiles down to be roughly as fast as any pure function in a statically compiled language</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah... only extra context is with reference counting and potentially with more cost due to immutability by default.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'effects' causes a larger amount of functions and deeper stacks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The biggest loss is really that the platform and the application are not a single compilation unit. As such, there is no inlining between the two. Even a C/C++/rust application without LTO will actually hit many similar inlining issues.</p>

<p>ohhh okay thank you very much. I'll try to think about this.</p>
