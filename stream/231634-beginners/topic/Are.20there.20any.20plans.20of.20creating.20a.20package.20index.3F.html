<p>Hi! I've recently started playing with Roc and I've noticed that the only way to find packages that other people have made is by keeping track of posts here (e.g. in <code>show and tell</code>) or by looking stuff up on Google and hoping to find something.</p>
<p>I was wonder, are there any plans to create some sort of package index for people to publish/register their packages? Or even something simpler like an "awesome-roc" github repo. I know Roc is still in "heavy development" but it seems to me there are already many useful packages, and is in good enough shape for people to make stuff with.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this already exists then I apologize for asking :) Thanks!</p>

<p>yes there are plans to make a package index (although the exact design is still in progress) and yes there also is a <a href="https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-awesome">roc-awesome</a> repo you can check out right now!</p>

<p>Another way to discover Roc packages is to browse all the repos on GitHub tagged with <code>roc-lang</code>. <a href="https://github.com/topics/roc-lang">https://github.com/topics/roc-lang</a></p>
