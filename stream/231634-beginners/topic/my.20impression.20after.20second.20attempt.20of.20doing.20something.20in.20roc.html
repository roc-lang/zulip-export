<p>Ok this is my second attempt to dabble in roc. This time I was focused  on implementing something, so I neglected all what was not vital to the task at hand. What I like A LOT is  capability to accomplish my goals using very few  syntax constructs. I could compare this only with my previous experience  with lua  when I could do  quite  decent  range  of  task with  almost no  knowledge  about  the language. Roc has the same  specifics and  that is very very  good news  for me (if  I have  experienced  couple of headaches I would definitely drop forever, and I experienced  those  only 1-2 times which is very few  compared to  clojure haskell and many  other languages I tried and dropped  ). I like  haw state is handled, how  errors  are  embedded in  language . I crunched  quite a bit of  numbers  and  execution  time was decent a promised. Syntax is  weird  but as I said  I only picked few  constructs and stick to them entire  time , so I had  chances  to get used to them. I like  how  ease it is to add new modules  and  how easy it is  to create application. I don't even know how  main or task works but still I could use  them  and accomplish  the goal</p>
