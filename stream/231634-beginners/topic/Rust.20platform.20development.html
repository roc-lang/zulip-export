<p>I am planning to write my own platform in Rust. I cannot find any documentation on how to do it. Taking a look at <code>basic-cli</code> is also really confusing. Nested ROC and Rust files. Glue code that is generated automatically, but nowhere is mentioned how it is generated.</p>
<p><code>roc glue</code> and <code>roc gen-glue-lib</code> exist, but take some files as input that I have no idea what they are.</p>
<p>It seems most operations with effects are inside the <code>Effect.roc</code> file. <code>generates Effect with [after, map, always, forever, loop]</code> seems to generate a struct/type but it's nowhere to be found. And the tutorial never mentions anything about the <code>generates</code> keyword. </p>
<p>Is there like a short tutorial on how to do this?</p>

<p>I have a PR I've been working on but haven't touched much lately to cleanup glue gen for basic-cli so you can just run a script. At the moment it is a fair mess because it's usually the first platform to get features (written by hand) and then the tooling and infrastructure catches up. If you checkout basic-webserver that has a nicer glue setup. But note there are still some issues with glue which mean we have some workarounds to make it work. So it's definitely do-able rn, but I wouldn't suggest it's easy.</p>

<p>Documentation for platforms hasn't been written yet, there is still a lot going on in that space and so it would be a challenge to keep it up to date.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="343810">@Brendan Hansknecht</span> done a few streams which go into detail about these things, and he explains along the way.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="515757">@Luke Boswell</span> I wouldn't mind having to dig into platforms and figure out how they work if the glue mechanism worked. But having to manually write glue definitions without internal knowledge seems challenging. Sure, I can eventually figure it out, but it takes time I'm not willing to spend right now. </p>
<p>I'll skip roc for now. It seemed like the perfect language/runtime for my project though...<br>
Thanks though, it is a super interesting project! I'll keep an eye on it :)</p>

<p>yeah I'd say check back maybe like mid-2024...platform development is pretty rough right now - we've made a bunch of investments in it, but we're only partway to a smooth experience there for sure <span aria-label="big smile" class="emoji emoji-1f604" role="img" title="big smile">:big_smile:</span> </p>
<p>thanks for checking it out, and hopefully it'll be a lot more solid when you check back!</p>
