<p>I took a stab at implementing <code>List.map4</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/rtfeldman/roc/pull/1853">https://github.com/rtfeldman/roc/pull/1853</a>. While I managed to do an implementation my understanding is at best superficial. My work was heavily based upon the work that was done for <code>List.map3</code> and I feel I have a gazillion questions regarding how all different parts are interconnected.</p>
<p>Would anyone be up for  one or more pair programming sessions where we go over the changes in more detail?</p>
<p>I'd also like to do whatever I can on my own to deepen my understanding regarding the specific areas. I've already taken the Rust course by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281383">@Richard Feldman</span> and I've rewritten some of my Ruby toy programs in Zig. I'm fully aware that learning both Rust and Zig will be a rather long journey, so I'm not trying to rush things, I think actively contributing to this project will help me "learn what I need" as I progress and I'm mainly putting my focus on Rust for now. Setting languages aside, compilers, codegen and LLVM is all a "black box" to me. Are there any resources or recommendations for those areas  that I can look at?</p>
<p>I'm having so much fun at the moment! <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>
