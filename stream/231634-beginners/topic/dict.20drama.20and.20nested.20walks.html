<p>I didn't complete Day 5 of Advent of Code, BUT I did save all the various <a href="https://github.com/JesterXL/advent-of-code-2022/tree/main/day5">compiler crashes</a>. Thanks a bunch for giving us a dope compiler for use during Advent of Code. Roc is super fun, and despite minor syntax changes from Elm, and 20 billion number choices (#Nat4LyfeDawg), I can't wait to get Roc into production against y'alls recommendation <span aria-label="stuck out tongue" class="emoji emoji-1f61b" role="img" title="stuck out tongue">:stuck_out_tongue:</span>. It was really fun this year learning a new language where I felt I was learning the built in modules, not actually the language hah! It just felt natural coming from Elm/ReScript/F#. Can't wait for <code>roc dev</code> to push my experiments into over drive. Also, mad props to all the docs. The release download + Mac instructions + the getting starting guide + the module docs were great to get moving and I referred to them constantly the past week. Appreciate the hard work that went into something y'all know may change frequently, I felt it was totally worth it.</p>

<p>Thanks for saving I'll of these. I'm definitely interested in digging into any of the dict related problems. I'm sure others will find the other crash reports useful as well</p>

<p>I am just gonna document here some of what I see from the different issue (Note: I am running from <code>main</code> so it may have bug fixes that have not yet been pulled into nightly):</p>
<p><code>Why is str.tonat failing, impossible</code><br>
I am guessing that this is hitting <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/4677">#4677</a> where <code>dbg</code> is printing values incorrectly rather than <code>Str.toNat</code> parsing the value wrong, but I am not 100% sure by just running the code.</p>
<p><code>roc test bug</code><br>
I think this is a type and a missing set of parenthesis (though maybe the parenthesis shouldn't be needed and parsing is wrong. It works if you change:<br>
<code>expect getCrates (Dict.emtpy |&gt; Dict.insert 1 ["A"]) 1 |&gt; List.first |&gt; Result.withDefault "" == "A"</code><br>
to:<br>
<code>expect (getCrates (Dict.empty |&gt; Dict.insert 1 ["A"]) 1 |&gt; List.first |&gt; Result.withDefault "") == "A"</code></p>
<p><code>roc test bug 2</code><br>
This is also hitting the same issue with a missing set of parenthesis. Also, once the parenthesis are added, I think the wrong function is used in a test. You have a dictionary that is passed into a function that expects a list.</p>
<p><code>run roc test thisfile to see bug</code><br>
I am not sure what the issue is with this file. If it is renamed to <code>Crates.roc</code>, it seems to work just fine.</p>
<p>The rest of the examples (<code>keep getting error blahhhhh</code>, <code>out of memory wat</code>, <code>panic</code>, <code>panic other patterns can't be applied</code>, <code>segfault</code>, <code>segfault when you roc dev</code>), I am not sure what is going on. They probably should all be filed as issues so someone can dig into them more. Thanks for collecting the logs.</p>
