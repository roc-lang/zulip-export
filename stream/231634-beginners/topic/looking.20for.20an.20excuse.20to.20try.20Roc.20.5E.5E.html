<p>Hi all, I've been following from afar and really like what you folks are doing with Roc. I'd like to try Roc at some point and was wondering if rewriting my elm test runner (<a href="https://github.com/mpizenberg/elm-test-rs">https://github.com/mpizenberg/elm-test-rs</a>) in Roc could be a good project. Currently it's written in Rust and consists mainly of 2 things, (1) a CLI app (http, reading/writing files, calling other programs like the elm compiler, Node, redirecting outputs, etc.) and (2) a dependency solver (<a href="https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub">https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub</a>) which is mainly pure computation delegating side effects to the caller. I wouldn't start now since I have to finish few things in pubgrub first, but could probably start before the end of year.</p>

<p>the CLI platform is currently being worked on, so I think its progress and your availability will line up nicely. Also it would be really cool to have such a solver in roc. It would be interesting too see how it performs (and if in-place  mutation has any value here)</p>

<p>mutations play a big part in the algorithm performance I believe, but that would need to be benchmarked.</p>

<p>I also have a benchmark setup to time the duration for solving all of elm packages. So this could easily serve as a benchmark comparing the rust and roc versions</p>
