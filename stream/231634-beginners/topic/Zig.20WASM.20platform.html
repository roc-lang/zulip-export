<p>Hi, I would like to call a Roc function from Javascript in the browser. My understanding is that there's no way to build Roc without a platform. I read that Zig should produce the smallest possible WASM bundle. I didn't find any example of a Zig WASM platform. I found some Rust WASM platforms (joy, galena), but so far I wasn't able to modify them for my use case. So, is there maybe some example I missed? And is my assumption about Zig being the best choice correct? Thanks!</p>

<p>No, I don't think we have any up to date zig wasm examples.</p>

<p>This is not my area of expertise but for <a href="https://www.roc-lang.org/repl">https://www.roc-lang.org/repl</a> we have basically the whole rust compiler in a 2.3 MiB tar.gz so I think you'll be alright with Rust :)</p>

<p>What was the problem here specifically?</p>
