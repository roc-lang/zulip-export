<p>Hey all, I was looking to attempt the <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc">1 billion rows challenge</a> with roc and since the input for this problem is pretty large (14.8GB in my case) I need to stream in the data. I looked at the <code>File.read</code> and <code>File.readBytes</code> docs and it seems they attempt to read it all in one go. Maybe I'm missing something. Is there an example of parsing large files I could look at?</p>

<p>I know this isn't answering your question, but just out of curiosity - did you manage to get correct answers in Roc on smaller-scale instances of the problem (my understanding is that the input size is effectively user-controlled)?</p>
<p>I tried it some time ago, but was running into some - non-intuitive to me (without having had the time to have doven into the weeds) - floating-point rounding/truncation issues, which I couldn't dedicate the time to look into at the time.</p>
<p>My plan was to eventually host a competition for the best Roc solution, which we could then showcase in the discussion section of the 1brc repository.</p>

<p>Yeah, probably should have a way to open a file and then read a chunk (I did that in the false interpreter). Also would be really nice to have a way to just mem map a file into a roc list.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="693045">@Hristo</span> honestly I haven't attempted a smaller scale version of the file yet. Maybe I'll try that until we get <code>File.readLine</code> in the cli platform or something similar to help with large files</p>

<p>I think that'd be the better approach for the time being, yes <span aria-label="thumbs up" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="thumbs up">:thumbs_up:</span></p>

<p>Just fyi, we have an issue for this <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/issues/205">https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/issues/205</a></p>
