<p>I remember a previous discussion where there was mention of a desire to allow Roc packages (and platforms) to import other packages for their own use, such that common resources have a single source of truth. IE: The <code>basic-cli</code> and <code>basic-webserver</code> platforms might both want to use <code>Utc</code>, and a date/time package might also want to use <code>Utc</code>. Just wondering if plans for such a feature have developed any farther?</p>

<p>I bring this up because I have realized that My Roc-IsoDate package will not be able to provide <code>Utc</code> as a parsed type. This is because <code>Utc</code> is an opaque type. If an app imports <code>Utc</code> from the platform, it cannot also import <code>Utc</code> from a package, since they will conflict, and since the type is opaque, if a function cannot simply return <code>Utc</code> and have have the app treat it like a <code>Utc</code> without importing the type from the package, like it could if the type were non-opaque.</p>

<p>This means that my package cannot provide the functionality to parse directly to <code>Utc</code>. It can  convert to nanos since the epoch which can then be converted into <code>Utc</code> by fromNanosSinceEpoch (not the end of the world, and what I will end up doing), but it means my intention for a unified API will be slightly less unified. </p>
<p>However this has reminded me how much I wish there were someway for packages and platforms to import other packages into their own code bases, and wondering if there are any plans around this.</p>

<p>yeah the current situation is because of a bug in how imports are implemented - but <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="489294">@Agus Zubiaga</span> has fixed it in a branch that hasn't quite been merged yet! That will let platforms depend on packages, and packages depend on other packages</p>
