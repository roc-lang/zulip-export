<p>Hi peeps!<br>
I recently split my roc code into two files and started playing with <code>roc test</code>. When I quickly save a roc file and run <code>roc test</code> suddenly vscode says it cannot save the file because it's will be overwritten and contained unsaved changes and I believe a popover in the corner saying the roc plugin is stuck saving the file. After that CPU goes up by 10-20 % and doesn't go down. Every time I do these steps it keeps going up until my CPU is completely eaten and when I close vscode it is stuck saying it is waiting for something to finish. After I reopen the whole VSCode, CPU goes back to normal. </p>
<p>I use roc in WSL in VSCode with a plugin "Roc (Unofficial)<code>v1.2.0</code>" by Ivan Demchenko.</p>
<p>Is that a known issue? Is that the right plugin?</p>

<p>I think that is a new issue</p>

<p>I've had this problem before and it was resolved <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/6336">https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/6336</a>, but it has recently returned.  I didn't bother opening another issue as I assumed it was a byproduct of another problem <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/6766">https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/6766</a>.</p>
