<p>One thing I really like about Elm is that there's a single well written elm/http package that lots of other packages have built off of to support various rest APIs. In Roc, if I want to write a package to support a rest API, do I need to maintain multiple versions of it for each platforms own http API?</p>

<p>our vision is that there is one package that exposes a <code>Request</code> type, and then many platforms can interpret that request description in whatever way they want</p>

<p>Unsure if we should create new topics on Zulip or write in those that have a similar name to our question?</p>
<p>So I have been playing around with the rust examples and am also learning some more rust along the way since I am completely new to the language. <br>
What I want to accomplish to get more familar with roc and writing platforms:</p>
<p>I want to write a little roc platform example that extends the <code>cli</code> <code>readLine</code> / <code>writeLine</code> example. But instead of shutting down after writing out your first and lastname I want it to repeat from the start and ask again! That seems like a reasonably small project.<br>
But I don't want to just while loop / re-allocating the unsafe block in the cli <code>lib.rs</code> main example.<br>
I want to learn and understand how to keep the roc program alive and let it recive / emit "events" / "callbacks".</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>#[no_mangle]
pub extern &quot;C&quot; fn rust_main() -&gt; i32 {
    let size = unsafe { roc_main_size() } as usize;
    let layout = Layout::array::&lt;u8&gt;(size).unwrap();
    // I don&#39;t just want to while loop around this block and endlessly re-init the roc program...
    unsafe {
        // TODO allocate on the stack if it&#39;s under a certain size
        let buffer = std::alloc::alloc(layout);

        roc_main(buffer);

        let result = call_the_closure(buffer);

        std::alloc::dealloc(buffer, layout);

        result
    };

    // Exit code
    0
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Could i get some help in how to accomplish that? <span aria-label="big smile" class="emoji emoji-1f604" role="img" title="big smile">:big_smile:</span><br>
Currently I do not know how to keep a roc program alive... or how to send "messages" back and forth between roc and the platform.</p>

<p>Yeah, platforms can be a bit complex and are still in the process of being made nicer. I think the process of making them will probably be some of the biggest Roc library and abi changes in the future. There are also still a few missing pieces that make certain platform architectures painful or at least hard to make.</p>
<p>Anyway, to attempt to answer your questions.<br>
1) Your goal shouldn't need any platform changes. You should just be able to use recursion in the roc app.<br>
2) Calling a closure is unsafe, so you would need the repeated unsafe block if you want to change the platform as you mentioned. That being said, you should be able to keep the allocation and deallocation outside of the loop and just reuse the buffer.<br>
3) Keeping a roc program alive with some basic state and event handling done in the host is currently really annoying to maybe impossible to do as expected (should hopefully be updated soonish). Currently the sdl example is blocked on issues related to that (<a href="https://github.com/rtfeldman/roc/issues/1797">exposing multiple functions to host</a> and type boxing). The easier option currently is probably to define your context in Roc and recursively use it. The false-interpreter example does everything in Roc with a context for state.</p>

<p>Thank you for that detailed step by step  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="343810">@Brendan Hansknecht</span> !</p>
<p>I added <code>main</code> as the last line and it did indeed work:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>main : Task {} *
main =
    {} &lt;- await (Stdout.line &quot;What&#39;s your first name?&quot;)

    firstName &lt;- await Stdin.line

    {} &lt;- await (Stdout.line &quot;What&#39;s your last name?&quot;)

    lastName &lt;- await Stdin.line

    Stdout.line &quot;Hi, \(firstName) \(lastName)!&quot;

    main
</code></pre></div>
<p>Altho I feel like this is not what I had in mind exactly, it certainly is a step in the right direction <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> <br>
There is no really any back and forth going on between Rust and Roc here. Would not work with a webserver platform for example. (if Roc blocks the thread in an infinite recursion "loop" and never lets the platform do anything anymore).<br>
I think part of my confusion might come from being a JS developer. The browser does not shut down after a "main" function has completed.<br>
I am so used to event based systems. Gonna take a look at that SDL github issue. Thank you.</p>

<p>Also, it is possible to have a webserver, it's just that currently it would have to be a webserver with only a single function exposed to the host. That function either would get called directly on each request, or it would return a list of closures to be called on specific requests. So definitely doable with current roc, but not a nice event loop structure where you expose a small handful of functions (eg: model, view, update).</p>

<p>There is a pr with a simple webserver. It probably still works, but hasn't been touched in a while. It opts for the first option of calling the same function for every request. It may also match what you are looking for.</p>

<p>I am hijacking this, hope this is okay.</p>
<p>So what I do not quite understand yet is how the link from my C API in the platform is made to the Roc code. Where is declared that I have to export <code>roc__mainForHost_1_exposed_generic</code> which then is <code>mainForHost</code> in the roc code? I do not see where that connection is made. And in addition: Am I allowed to export any symbol and it is automatically linked to roc? So for example if I have a <code>fn get_four() -&gt; i32 { 4 }</code> and I want to make that available in roc (of course via C calling convention, not via Rust calling convention), how do I export it to roc?</p>

<p>The one function exposed to the host could be any one function with any set of arguments and return value. So it could be an event handler or something similar.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="453579">@Matthias Beyer</span> we definitely need to start improving the docs around this especially for platform builders. Essentially the package-config.roc defines the c API. It specifies which functions are imported and exported from roc. Then roc, when compiling, expects those functions with some minor name changes. Exposed functions from roc are definitely the most complex because they may return closures.</p>

<p>I will try, but I may not have the best answer. If I am off base, hopefully someone will jump in and correct me.</p>
<p>Essentially an Effect is a promise or a future. A wrapper that is capable of giving you a value. This is a type built into Roc. I think (though I could be wrong) that it is required as the return type from all platform functions. Roc deals with this translation internally, and the platform can still just return raw types.</p>
<p>A Task on the other hand is a common Roc module that is used to deal with the possibility of failure. A task is defined as <code>Task ok err : Effect.Effect (Result ok err)</code>. It enables nice chain-ability when it comes to the potential of errors. For example, <code>Task.await</code>, takes a task, runs a transformation on result if it is not an error and then returns a task that might or might not be an error.</p>

<p>Ah, okay... how would you recommend I learn a platform's API? Maybe your "Edges of Cutting-Edge  Languages talk?"   Just figuring out where to go from looking at the initial Hello World examples (and this seems to be the next step).</p>

<p>(After quickly reading about RNG in Elm...) Are you referring to Elm's <code>step</code> function? Or would an effectful function like <code>generate</code> be preferable?</p>
<p>Perhaps RNG-supportive Roc platforms should provide a seed generator function like <code>getSeed : {} -&gt; U128</code>, and then platform-agnostic randomness packages can provide ergonomic abstractions. (Ex: <code>choice : List a, U128 -&gt; a</code>)</p>
<p>Of course, platforms could also provide their own domain-specific abstractions. (Hmm, I can't think of a good example.)</p>

<p>Perfect. I wonder what percentage of platforms will support RNG! I'm used to it as a language built-in, but I suppose that some application categories need it more than others (game engines vs. text editors?). That might be reflected in different platform authors seeing it as critical vs. bloat.</p>

<p>yes. Note that with the <code>constantSeed</code> you could use any entropy. So e.g. if your application has users, you could use the username as the initial seed (need some hashing or something to turn it into a number, but it's doable)</p>

<p>that Elm implementation is based on <a href="https://www.pcg-random.org/">https://www.pcg-random.org/</a> (hence the name <code>random-pcg</code>), although it had to do some tricks to work around how browsers don't support 64-bit integers natively (or didn't at the time), such as using two 32-bit integers instead</p>

Not sure if you're aware of this already but if you're trying to figure out what some unfamiliar Elm code is doing, then <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Debug#log">Debug.log</a> is your friend.

<p>Example for a 2D platformer (like Super Mario): The platform says that there must be a <code>Player</code> that <code>jump</code>s, but the Roc app must specify when the jump happens via keymapping, how the jump looks via animation curve, when the jump is allowed via state machine rules, and how the jump is interrupted via collision rules. <span aria-label="smiley" class="emoji emoji-1f603" role="img" title="smiley">:smiley:</span></p>

<p>Allright, adding an alias for clarity</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>T : 
    {
        h : U32,
        i : I32,
        j : List U32,
        k : List I32,
    }

U : 
    {
        b : Str,
        c : U8,
        d : U32,
        e : List U8,
        f : List U32,
        g : T,
        x : List { y : Str, z : Str } 
    }
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can start with <code>T</code>: the rule is sort first by alignment, then by field name.<br>
(for this you need to know some stuff about alignment, I can elaborate if you're not sure how that works)</p>
<p>For this record, we're done immediately (lists store a pointer and a length (as a nat/usize) and hence have the alignment of a pointer which is equal to the alignment of a usize). </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>{
    h : U32,
    i : I32,
    j : List U32,
    k : List I32,
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Compound structures have the alignment equal to the maximum of the alignment of their fields. That means we can sort the fields by alignmenthere:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>{
    c : U8,
    d : U32,
    b : Str,
    e : List U8,
    f : List U32,
    g : T,
    x : List { y : Str, z : Str } 
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>because of the names you picked this is also already sorted by field name</p>

<p>Whoa, when I add another <code>F32</code> between them, it hears the 1st as the 1st and the 2nd as the 3rd!<br>
Roc source: <code>config = { ballSpeed: 111, manualPadding: 222, paddleSpeed: 333 }</code><br>
Rust debug: <code>Config { ballSpeed: 111.0, manualPadding: 0.0, paddleSpeed: 222.0 }</code><br>
This must be related to alignment, but I don't know how. Maybe... Roc is writing the record with 8-byte alignment (because it's represented with an 8-byte pointer) but then Rust isn't recognizing the padding between the 4-byte <code>F32</code>s?<br>

<p>Okay, here's a new request... is passing a function as a record field possible?</p>
<p>Since only one def can be passed from an app to a platform, I see only two ways of passing both static primitive data and dynamic function logic:</p>
<ol>
<li>pass a record containing both primitive fields and function fields</li>
<li>pass a function that either returns primitive data or performs dynamic logic, depending on the input</li>
</ol>

<p>Hi, new here. I read through a bunch of platform posts here, but after looking at the examples, I don't think I understand platforms at all. Should I, some time in the future, decide to write a simple cli tool in Roc, would there be a standard platform for this purpose? Would it only support nix or windows at one time? I'm confused why there are rust examples and zig examples, and why anyone writing an app would care what language the platform is written in?</p>

<p>Sorry, I meant *nix, as any random linux. I run Windows, but built Roc in WSL Ubuntu last night, and will be playing with it there.<br>
The platforms that are in the examples seem(and this is fine for this purpose) custom built out with just enough functionality to support the example they work for. This is part of my confusion.

<p>Regarding Rust/Zig, Roc app developers shouldn't care what language their platform is written in.</p>
<p>I think about Roc platforms like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roc is basically a scripting language for C-interoperable languages like Rust/Zig, and a Roc platform is basically a Rust/Zig app with some Roc-specific metadata/decoration.</li>
<li>When the Roc CLI builds a Roc app, it does two things: it compiles the Roc app into a set of C functions that the Roc platform can call via CFFI (calling C functions from a C-interoperable language), and then it uses the Roc platform's language's compiler to compile those C functions together with the Roc platform into machine code.</li>
<li>A Roc platform must define all data types that it sends/receives to/from Roc apps, and a Roc app must provide its Roc platform with the def (in the future hopefully multiple defs) that the platform requires.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, a Roc platform can use any of its language's features (Rust crates, Zig libraries, etc.), and a Roc app can use any Roc features (Roc libraries, etc.).</li>
<li>Therefore, the only reasons for a Roc platform developer to choose Rust vs. Zig (vs. something else?) is the libraries they want to leverage and their personal preferences.</li>
<li>As (I think) the example platforms in <code>examples/</code> don't use any unique libraries, I expect that the languages chosen in there were mostly chosen arbitrarily, to demonstrate Roc's flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that makes platforms make more sense, but now that I've written it all out I realize this could just confuse the issue <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span></p>

<p>These still feels like you would be in a place where a Roc app developer could need to also write their underlying platform(or copy/paste from a previous similar app and add new lib Y). Am I misunderstanding?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No, you're correct. If an app wants to do something that its platform doesn't support, then it will need to fork+modify the platform or find another platform. That's by design, so that app consumers/end-users can be absolutely certain what any app might do when they run it. For example, if an app's platform doesn't have networking or file-writing functionalities, you know it's (relatively) safe to run.</p>

<p>When passing a List from a platform to a Roc application, does the List always have to be reference counted? <code>compiler/str/README.md</code> mentions that the platform can't assume anything about Lists provided by Roc application, but AFAICT doesn't say anything about Lists passed the other way around.<br>

<p>So, should I give up the 09 branch and try with master? Will that get rid of the llvm unresolveds?</p>

<p>Just to add a bit more detail, the exact issue I had was that my clone of the repo, and therefore the Cargo <code>target</code> folder, was on the Windows side in the NTFS filesystem. But I was running <code>cargo test</code> and <code>cargo build</code> in the Linux terminal, so Cargo was also using the <code>~/.cargo</code> folder from the Linux ext4 filesystem. So it must have been talking to both filesystems, maybe copying stuff between them, probably going through some sort of translation layer...</p>
<p>The fix that worked for me was to move everything to the Linux filesystem. There were no other steps to it, just that.</p>
<p>But the commands that Andrew ran in his screenshot don't look like they would have the same issue since all the files are on the Linux side, and he's running Roc rather than Cargo.</p>

<p>i haven't finished the tutorial yet but is there an argc/argv interface in the common platforms ?</p>

<p>I don't think any platform in the examples currently exposes this, though it shouldn't be too hard to do. This could be a candidate for a <a href="https://github.com/rtfeldman/roc/issues/2498">standard platform</a>.</p>
<p>(Digression: I wonder if argc/argv should be more standardized in the language, or always handled in the host, because right now if the host exposes them they must be wrapped in an Effect - but (I think) they need not be effect-ful, since they're supplied by the kernel)</p>

<p>Yeah so the classic <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> interface is just the way that you represent an array of strings in C. In Roc, the same information would be represented as <code>List Str</code>. So I think platforms would expose command line arguments to Roc as <code>List Str</code>. Once it's in Roc you'll generally want to parse the CLI arguments for your program into a nice Tag Union. That parsing library can be pure Roc code. There are similar libraries in Elm for URLs, for example.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is called tree shaking or lazy loading or what...<br>
Is there any way for a platform to include/exclude imported libraries in/from the eventual machine code if the app does/doesn't use them? Example: A Rust-based platform imports two different stdout formatting crates, A and B. An app might do either <code>Task.await (Stdout.lineA "hello")</code> or <code>Task.await (Stdout.lineB "hello")</code>, and therefore the executable might only need crate A or crate B but not both. Is that a possible optimization, or does CFFI not grant us that level of compile-time insight?</p>

<p>There might be another way to support dead code elimination at the platform level, platform language permitting. </p>
<p>Por example, let's say every publicaclly exposed function in Rust gets its own feature flag (this can be done automatically). Roc knows what functions are being exposed by rust, and can therefore emit the feature flags for the exact functions it needs. Rustc would take care of DCE natively.</p>
<p>I believe something similar should be possible with zig, but don't know.</p>

<p>That definitely would work. That being said, I think generally speaking DCE doesn't matter too much, but if we want it in the future, there are many ways to add it. Personally I think feature flags are a less optimal solution. They require rebuilding the host and would have to be uniquely done for each host language.</p>

<p>so if it's absolutely unavoidable to depend on a dynamic library (e.g. for licensing reasons), we can actually detect when it's missing right when you install the platform, and say "hey your system can't install this platform because it needs this other thing to be installed first; here are the instructions the platform author wrote for what to do if you find yourself in this situation: _______"</p>

<p>100% true. I have been messing around with embedded Roc and it currently wastes a lot memory. The current problem is that Roc compiles for speed rather than size, and it's unused functions are not garbage collected. So it is actually roc side problems, not host side.</p>

<p>Hmm, actually I am wrong about the size cost here. The real problem looks to be the loss of inlining. The binary bloats by way more than the size of the roc app. So when the app was completely rust, it inlined and greatly simplified most of the code. Since part is in roc, the inline potential is much more limited.<br>
In this case, the Roc app is 1582 bytes, but using roc leads to the binary bloating by 4120 bytes.</p>

<p>If the platform is precompiled for all the architectures you want to target, roc essentially just hooks into that and is extremely portable. So cross compilation should be very easy. But yeah, depends on the platform supporting your target and llvm at least supporting the CPU architecture you're targeting.</p>

<p><code>link.rs</code> was cobbled together and has grown naturally. It really is not how we want to do linking in the long term. It works for most people, so it generally doesn't get messed with too much. I don't remember why, but I know that not clearing environment variables led to breakages on some machines<br>
 I know at one point there were some modifications to get it working on nixos (not sure if they got merged). Those might help with getting it working on guix.<br>
Overall, please feel free to modify it and open pull requests. It could use some cleanup.</p>

<p>Why glibc? IMHO it would be a good thing to decouple Roc from the C compiler/runtime, just use whatever CC/CFLAGS/LDFLAGS are defined... That would simplify quite a bit <a href="http://link.rs">link.rs</a>.</p>

<p>to elaborate a bit, the surgical linker basically says "give me a working executable that attempts to dynamically link the Roc application entrypoint" (typically the <code>main</code> provided by the application author) and after the Roc application gets compiled into machine code, I will incorporate it into that executable and replace that dynamic linking with static linking after the fact</p>

<p>Very cool. Great to know the goal. For the embedded case, I don't think you will touch any roc linking stuff at all. Instead, I believe that you would just have roc emit a static library. Then you would have the embedded targeting platform deal with all of the linking.<br>

<p>The main problem that I believe will limit roc for embedded is that roc and the platform are two separate chunks of code. They are not compiled together. They can't take advantage of inlining. This can add a huge number of bytes to an executable. In the roc-microbit case, using roc costs about 2500 bytes more than just using rust due to the loss of inlining.</p>
<p>Of course, depending on the platform boundary this could potentially be greatly reduced.<br>
In reality, the solution is probably LTO between the platform and the Roc app, but that is hard because LTO is dependent on the specific version of LLVM. So it would be very brittle. Also more complex to setup in general.</p>

<p>For example, I think things are made worse by embedded rust. Embedded rust is a giant pile of "zero" cost abstractions. The issue is that they depend on inline to be abstracted away. So when we break the inlining, I think it causes the rust to bloat. I think C or rust without the abstractions could be done in a way that the inlining basically didn't cause any problems.</p>

<p>I think optimizing for speed may be the same as -O2: <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/CodeGen_8h_source.html">https://llvm.org/doxygen/CodeGen_8h_source.html</a></p>

<p>Ah, that would make sense.

<p>So I just tested adding optimizing for size to roc. Makes quicksort 3x larger. I guess something we do in our llvm generation really depends on some of the more aggressive optimizations.</p>

Hi all, I am a beginner to Roc, so I might overlook something, but I can't explain the following incomplete output when running time.roc:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>main =
    start &lt;- Utc.now |&gt; Task.await
    dbg start       # =&gt; [time.roc 14:9] @Utc 1685614693863401198
    {} &lt;- slowTask |&gt; Task.await    # =&gt; Tried to open a file...
    finish &lt;- Utc.now |&gt; Task.await
    dbg finish      # =&gt; [time.roc 18:9] @Utc 1685614693863545706
    duration = Utc.deltaAsNanos start finish |&gt; Num.toStr
    dbg duration
    Stdout.line &quot;Completed in \(duration)ns&quot;

slowTask : Task.Task {} []
slowTask =
    path = Path.fromStr &quot;not-a-file-but-try-to-read-anyway&quot;
    result &lt;- File.readUtf8 path |&gt; Task.attempt
    when result is
        _ -&gt; Stdout.line &quot;Tried to open a file...&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>The dbg output of start and finish is shown, as well as Stdout.line from slowtask, but no output of dbg duration or no Stdout.line with durarion output. What could be a reason for this? Is this a bug? Thanks!</p>

<p>I could be confusing with other topics, but I think there's some bugfixing happening around <code>Num.toStr</code> and I'm just wondering if that would be the culprit as to why <code>dbg duration</code> would not print <span aria-label="thinking" class="emoji emoji-1f914" role="img" title="thinking">:thinking:</span></p>

<p>You're right! dbg duration then prints out! But there is no Stdout.line display of duration. The problem with Num.toStr  probably  still prevents that, no error is shown, just no output.  Thanks anyway!</p>

<p>We will need to see more source to diagnose that. Probably has nothing to do with zig, but instead roc loading or specific parsing issues.</p>
