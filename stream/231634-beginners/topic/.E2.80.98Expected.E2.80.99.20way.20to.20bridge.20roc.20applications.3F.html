<p>Hey all, </p>
<p>I’m eagerly awaiting a Mac Mini M4 and I’m looking at transitioning my existing computer to server role with an eye towards creating a few toy apps that let me hook into the linux environment from the mac desktop.</p>
<p>My (likely overly naive) view is that I’d have a roc app running on the basic-cli platform server side, with a receiving roc app running the swift platform. </p>
<p>Obviously this could ‘just’ be a network connection (or a unix socket perhaps?), but I’m wondering if there’s a good/idiomatic way to bridge two platforms regardless of the 1 app = 1 platform paradigm.</p>
<p>As I was writing this I realized/remembered that Swift also runs on Linux, so it can be the same platform on both sides in this imagined case, but the idea of reaching for some other ecosystem on the linux side through Roc as opposed to though Swift’s C ABI is very exciting.</p>
<p>I hope that makes sense, and I’m aware that I might not realize what I’m actually asking for, but guidance would be appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="688206">@Jesse Nutt</span>,<br>
The swift platform got removed from the repo a couple of moths ago (I don't recall why) but here it is:<br>

<p>Yeah, it seems like sticking to http would be best, <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/blob/0.18.0/examples/http-get-json.roc">example</a></p>
