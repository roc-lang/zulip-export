<p>Roc beginner here</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.roc-lang.org/platforms">https://www.roc-lang.org/platforms</a>, I get the notion that "platforms" really modularize Roc's capabilities. </p>
<p>The stdlib doesn't ship with concurrency primitives, but if someone wanted to implement Golang-esque Channels or an Actor Model, platforms would be the way to do that?</p>

<p>Yeah, its going to really cool when we're back at the stage with a working zig compiler people can start building platforms again. We've learnt a lot about how to architect things so its much easier and more performant. I'm pretty sure we'll see lots of awesome experimental platforms soon, testing out different ideas and ways to use roc.</p>

<p>Hey all! </p>
<p>Just figured I add to this topic... First off, amazing language, love the overall idea/syntax/etc. (I'm a big Elm fan, also love Elixir.)</p>
<p>So, yeah, I guess I have a question re: platform concept. It seems like the idea is that an application has one and only one "platform"?</p>
<p>I'm not 100% sure this makes total sense to me? I'm sure this has all been debated and discussed at length, so I apologize in advance if this is just a rehashing of old dialogues!</p>
<p>Take two examples. First, Python. The way most people use Python is more like a wrapper to other native code, e.g. C and bit of Fortran  (Numpy), C++ &amp; CUDA (PyTorch), Rust (Polars), etc.</p>
<p>Second, the NodeJS alternative Bun, which uses Zig as the glue. If you go to their home page, they are touting Bun's performance on three things: Express (e.g. webserver), Postgres, and WebSockets.</p>
<p>The Bun webserver is literally µWebSockets (written in C++), which I think is a bit... uncool? that they don't really say that, and the websocket server is likewise literally µSockets (written in C), again, odd that they don't spell that out, while Postgres in an internal Zig library.</p>
<p>My point is, that from the user's perspective, you just import them as regular libraries and use them, unaware that they are written in different languages (C++, C and Zig) under the hood.</p>
<p>(I get that Zig is amazing at gluing all this together!)</p>
<p>But I guess my point is that, personally, the idea of having a single "server platform" that has all of these things baked in (e.g. web, ws, sql, etc) seems logical? And likewise, that you could then add your own independently without having to edit the main "platform"?</p>
<p>As opposed to having a bunch of independent backends (platforms) that only do a small part of what you need? Like why is the "webserver" platform different from the "cli" platform? </p>
<p>In my experience, backend code evolves, so at first may only need one thing (e.g. web server), but then you need access to a db, local file access, a pdf generator, S3 access, a job queue, ftp access, image generators, an in-memory db, etc. So if each of those things require side effects, then it seems like you need a way to add them w/o requiring someone to understand the "platform"? For example, maybe the main platform is Rust, but I am XYZ programmer and want to use another language for a job queue.</p>
<p>For me, I mentally compare Roc against the various other backend language and ecosystems like Python, Node, Elixir, Rust, Go, etc. , and am just thinking about how the Roc platform concept either helps or hinders the idea of using Roc as a potential replacement for say Node in the long term.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for thoughts! :)</p>

<p>Two core thoughts here. Just to give a super quick answer. One more theoretical and one more technical.</p>
<p>Firstly, think of Elm. A gigantic part of the reason elm is amazing is that it has exactly one "platform". Elm curates your entire experience in building a web app. This curation is what leads to elm being an amazing and delightful experience. Any time you have to leave the curation bubble and interact with JS, life gets worse. Roc is the same way. It just has many potential platforms. Each platform tries to curate in a way to make an amazing experience. The platform can still add escape hatches if it wants (raw access to os primitives, libffi support, etc). But using those escape hatches will be painful in comparison to staying within the curated experience. Since roc is such a young language, most platforms only have the curated expecience (that said, the curation is not always the best and as nice as something like elm).</p>
<p>On the technical side, ultimately roc is producing a single executable. An executable can only have one main function and has to compile into a single binary on the machine. The platform controls all of this. As such, two platforms in one executable does not make technical sense. How would I create an application with two main functions? which would run?</p>

<p>So one platform is more of a fundamental constraint. That said, we could definitely make escape hatches easier if we wanted (we don't though).</p>

<p>One could make the ultimately flexible roc platform if they wanted, it would be a main function and only expose a wrapper around <a href="https://sourceware.org/libffi/">libffi</a>. With that, all c ffi compatible code would be accessible. It would be a horrible experience, but it would fundamentally be able to talk to essentially all software and do anything. No platform yet exposes <code>libffi</code>, but I expect it to eventually happen for a super flexible escape hatch.</p>

<p>I think another aspect of this is the ecosystem being pure roc... the boundary for API's moves a little up to a higher abstraction. So platforms will tend to provide lower level primitives, and that means more functionality can be provided by cross-platform libraries. </p>
<p>For example, any platforms that provide TCP-like primitives can probably support a large number of roc packages and functionality from interfacing with SQL servers, sending HTTP requests, etc.</p>
<p>From an app authors perspective the focus in more on higher level functionality and integrating libraries.</p>
<p>If more flexibility is required than the platform (or a cross-platform package) provides, I expect it to be common to fork the platform and easily implement customised parts for a particular use-case.</p>

<p>Cool. Makes sense! Yes, that is a good analogy re: Elm and JS.</p>
<p>Also, the single executable... interesting...</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean (now responding to Luke), if the whole goal of Roc is to be super-fast (e.g. faster than Go, I believe Richard said), then the idea of providing a platform with a low level set of system primitives (including TCP, etc) would encourage the writing of a web server in Roc, websockets in Roc, sql client in Roc, etc.</p>
<p>Personally, the idea of forking a platform sounds seems... counter-intuitive? I'd think you'd want a small number of very low level, bulletproof platforms? Like "server", "wasm", "embedded", "browser", that kind of thing?</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for the thoughts!</p>

<p>Yeah, a lot of possiblities. One is the low level apis and all roc. Another is more high level bespoke experiences, but maybe with more restrictions. I think it will be a mix of both in practice depending on the exact goals</p>

<p>I think it's a nice feature that both are totally reasonable options with Roc and have different trade-offs. </p>
<p>I can start with a friendly batteries included web-server, and if my needs outgrow that I can roll over the top with an more customised platform that suits my needs (tuned for performance or provides unique capabilities).</p>

<p>Cool. Yeah, Cmd is a necessary escape hatch, and could handle lots of "fork/exec" stuff, e.g. calling ffmpeg, etc. As long as you use Cmd for "slow" stuff &amp; have a worker pool in front of it, should be fine.</p>
<p>I guess it comes down to really asking the question: "What is the first world real use-case for Roc?"</p>
<p>For example, Elixir was trying to replace Ruby on Rails. So the first real world "test" of the Elixir language was the creation of the Ecto library, an ORM for sql, as that was seen as a fundamental requirement to build a web server backends and ultimately replace rails.</p>
<p>As everything I work on tends to be... API driven? E.g. web server serving JSON, HTML, handling Websockets &amp; calling a bunch of stuff on the backend behind the scenes, I look at languages through that lens. (Obviously Async + green threads (or imitate Tokio) is all key for this kind of stuff.) As opposed to writing a command line util, etc.</p>
<p>So that's why when I view of Roc, I am looking at to see how it would ultimately compare to say Node, Phoenix/Elixir, Go, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe that's not the goal! Maybe the goal is embedded dev! Or build tools like Vite. Or writing compilers, like Microsoft just moved the Typescript compiler to Go. Or writing GPU code, like Mojo. Etc.</p>
<p>But in general, I think working backward from a goal is a good strategy :)</p>
<p>I guess with the Platform concept, the idea is you can kick this can down the road? E.g. once the language and Platform interfaces is solid, then someone can write an "async networking platform" that would allow someone to build a batteries-included web framework?</p>

<p>Just adding two cents here. The way I see it, in Elm you kind of already have this ""platforms"" concept. I recently had to do a headless Elm application and I ended up using <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Platform#worker">Platform.worker</a> instead of <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser#application">Browser.application</a>. <br>
It's still Elm, you just don't get a <code>view</code> function. <br>
What I love about the ROC idea on platforms is that I can see in one place (Main module) where have we taken the "capabilities" from the platform and to which libraries/functions have they been passed to. Please don't ever let go of that core principle 🙏🏻</p>
