<p>Since I am  using  Roc for  quite some time I would like share  my opinion about pros and cons of the language</p>
<p>pros -&gt; in  general  this language  has simplicity build in, using only handful of abstraction I am able to   do a lot(this alone is insane in comparison to C++ for example) . I like  structure of those programs just redirecting data from one place to another via  functions.<br>
It goes deep, having  my day to day work and programming from time to time is difficult  I have only so much  of my mental resources to  spare on this. In C++  (and  other  languages I tried  including  python, haskell, even lua )  but especially C++ burnout  of my "daily mental  resources" is immense. I just can't effort to  spend  so much of my  daily focus and  at the same time  make  next to zero progress. Roc stands out in that regard I am wasted to  but I see  some progress. This ratio  of  effort-&gt; result I am getting is acceptable. It is deal breaker for me. I can  still hold  my live  balance  in a grip. That's the reason I haven't moved to next thing and  I plan to stay, provided  that you do not spoil  design by unnecessary  levels of  complexity/weird magic/ to much  syntactic  sugar.</p>
<p>cons -&gt;<br>
lack of  multiline  comment  (kind of annoying ) <br>
crashing  dbg  (very annoying)<br>
general immaturity  (I feel it all the time)<br>
lack  of multithreading  (this I plan  to use in the  future)<br>
no bit and byte access (I think  sometime it is useful to be  able to access float/integers byte by byte or  bits, especially during some low level stuff tweaking  )</p>
<p>other  remarks:<br>
overall I don't get how application is created which  is kind of  obvious when I am using  C or C++ this may be meaningful if I  at some point decide to create  application on microcontroller  (bare metal). Somehow I don't get how those  abstraction are translated to real code. How I will access specific  address  etc.     </p>
<p>there  are  some things in language  itself,  which makes working with  it manually tedious at times ("when..  is" block  all over the place).  <br>
In that regard  I consider  it  to be my  homework,  to just get used to it. I would not expect  improvements necessarily. Good  outcome is that  those  constructions are  forcing me to  think about  things I usually neglect, so  it may be  good thing overall, but still uncomfortable and  time  consuming</p>

<p>I'd like to do this, although there are some design questions because endianness makes doing it a tricky to be both performant and also consistent across targets</p>

<p>To be fair on the endianness, it may be reasonable to just start by not caring. Swapping from little to/from big endian has to be <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/bswap">builtin</a> and fast in processors cause processors are almost always little endian and network protocols are big endian. We probably could just make both functions.</p>
<p>The other important factor is we have tuples which should allow this all to be done in a cpu register instead of requiring allocating a list.</p>

<p>another design question is what number types should support it.</p>
<p>ints seem fine, but exposing the internal structure of <code>Dec</code> would make changing that structure in the future a breaking change.</p>
<p>also for floats I'm not sure if the NaN flags are consistent enough across CPUs that they'd actually give the same answer regardless of target</p>

<p>Given rocs design, the platform is essentially the runtime of a roc application and decides all of the primitives that it has access to. Currently there aren't that many platforms and custom ones would often be a requirement.</p>
<p>This does limit the roc ecosystem. It is not easy to just pick an arbitrary library in c and depend on it in a roc app. That library would have to be exposed to roc through a platform. As such, roc kinda depends on platform developers building custom experience for roc users (kinda like how elm gives a custom web UI experience, but is otherwise quite limited in functionality).</p>
<p>Note, through tools like libffi, a platform could give a roc application dynamic access to code in any shared library, but I assume this would be pretty uncommon.</p>

<p>If you wanted to depend on an arbitrary rust library in a basic CLI app for example, the simplest solution would be to fork the platform. Add the new library and wrapping effects for each function you want to use and then use that instead of the original basic CLI platform.</p>

<p>So our current constraint is 32bit systems and requiring some compiler target hacking cause we don't expose everything needed for this. So without messing with the compiler, you are stuck more with like arm 32bit Linux, but with very minor target hacking any arm or riscv 32bit microcontroller should be a possible target</p>

<p>Oooo cool, thanks. That's good to hear that it's feasible.<br>
Currently the best language I've found for doing embedded development is nim.... But nim has... Problems. I feel like of all people y'all are probably pretty likely to know a bit about a high-level high performance language that does reference counting. </p>
<p>I like many things about the nim language, but the design feels extremely scattered and just has the "kitchen sink approach" but it also is majorly lacking in really basic ways. No interfaces, so no ability to do mocking and testing. No good unit testing story at all for that matter. Plus the editor tooling is a mess despite being a mature language. And I mean a mess at the compiler level. I looked at trying to improve it and it felt totally futile as someone who isn't part of the core team. </p>
<p>Anyway, I feel like roc, with a focus on performance,  and the whole platforms business, might be a good choice in future for high powered platforms like ESP and STM</p>
<p>Side note, does roc have arrays? I couldn't find any array syntax</p>

<p>regarding my remark about (when is) block <br>
I make up my mind  what I don't like<br>
Sometimes in a function  I already determined that let say list is no empty <br>
But  logic goes on  an  when I am using  the same  array in different  context, although in the  same  data path when it was establish already , that it is not  empty. Again I have to use (when  is )  block,  with  possible  error -&gt;  array  empty <br>
I agree first time  it  make  sense but  second  time ?? <br>
List.first  could be smart  in  this  case  and  work  without  (Ok/Err  - as an  option  if  somebody insist it should be still allowed )  compiler  could  easily figure  this  out. This  may  cause some  confusion  at first  but  for seasoned  programmer, it would be efficient and  maybe  cleaner  in long  run</p>

<p>One way you can get around that is once you confirm that the list is not empty, take the first element and make a (a, List a). Then you have encoded in the type that it is non empty and can explicitly work with the first element.</p>

<p>I think this could be done with dependent types but that would significantly increase compiler complexity. It could be something we look at in the future, but for now the compiler has enough complex bugs without using dependent types :p</p>

<p>A quick comment. Often times calling <code>List.isEmpty</code> is the issue. You don't really want to call it if you are also going to call something like <code>List.last</code>. instead, you should just call <code>List.last</code> where you would have called <code>List.isEmoty</code> and use the error case of <code>List.last</code> as your check for whether or not the list is empty. I often find a lot of code that check a list twice can be rewritten to just check it once. Using the errors is the important part</p>

<p>Oh also, if you really want, you can make a function that will unwrap a result or crash. Then you can do:</p>
<p><code>List.last ... |&gt; crashOnError</code></p>
<p>Given the error case is impossible, this may be fine.</p>

<p>that can work, but I specifically don't want to add a function like that to builtins because it makes crashing convenient...and unless you're writing a throwaway script or something (e.g. for Advent of Code) there's usually a more graceful way to handle the error, which I'd prefer to make feel relatively more natural!</p>

<p>Yeah definitely really hacky. </p>
<p>The roc type system is so nice, so there are really nice ways to handle errors and have a good program flow, but I'm still getting used to writing things a little differently and discovering these patterns.</p>

<p>it is  out of  control  of compiler (that's bad) but this communicates  the  notion that, there has  to be value here, anything  different is just ridiculous. In such scenario inventing error messages or  alternative  paths flow is  tedious( at least  for me)</p>

<p>To clarify here, with restructuring your code and potentially using result helper methods, there should be a cleaner solution to this.</p>
<p>The crash function I mentioned above is just a simple solution to remove some of the tedium. I would have to analyze specific code more deeply to give examples of how it could be rewritten to take advantage of other roc patterns to clean up the code.</p>
<p>If you share links to specific functions that are bad, I can try and see if I can show off other patterns to help clean them up.</p>

<p>I definitely would prefer links to real functions rather than examples. I think full context is often important for these kinds of suggesttions.</p>
<p>That said, I'll still comment on snippets and see If I can help some.</p>
<p>For the first example, I see two main options:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="CoffeeScript"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nv">k</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span>

<p>This second option would be to try and use the result related apis.<br>
I am going to do something very direct, but this requires context to see what would fit best in a full function.</p>

<p>things like this I consider  horrible btw.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>when List.get lst 7 is
    Ok x if List.len &lt; 10 -&gt; ...
    _ -&gt; ...
</code></pre></div>
<p>I don't even understand  what is intention  here when I see this</p>
<hr>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>when k is
    [first, .., last] | [first as last] -&gt; ...
    _ -&gt; ...
</code></pre></div>
<p>above  is  acceptable </p>
<hr>
<p>but  below is better </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>k = [2,3,4]
when (List.first k, List.last k) is
    (Ok first, Ok last) -&gt;
        ...
    _ -&gt;
        ...
</code></pre></div>
<hr>
<p>and  horrible  again </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>res =
    first &lt;- List.first k |&gt; Result.try
    last &lt;- List.last k |&gt; Result.try
    # use first and last. Errors are now grouped and would be handled elsewhere

# handle every single error at the end
when res is
    Ok ... -&gt;
    Err ... -&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>My general view<br>
For  me  code  should be very  simple in construction (if I don't  understand specific line in like 0.3 sec, this line is a  failure , I mean in it's structure  composition, I still could  have not  idea why it is there, that's is  fine for me )<br>
It is different story with entire application, complexity  may lay  in program structure because  sometimes  problem  one  has to solve  isn't necessarily  easy, so  intricate structure although not welcome it is something  I have to live  with  at times. Although  in many cases it happens because of lack  of imagination but  still there is no way around it(mind limitations)</p>

<p>That's totally fair. I think if you use tasks enough, syntaxes like <code>Task.await</code> and <code>Result.try</code> become a lot clearer, but I understand avoiding them. I did that for a very long time.</p>

<p>I have experienced this problem in the past as well, this made me think of a simplified view (with for example editor plugin) for roc files that hides all uses of <code>Task.await</code>, <code>Result.try</code>, backpassing and general error handling. A lot of the time you don't care about the specifics of the error handling and just want to understand what the code does for the case where everything goes right (no empty lists, no errors...). I have not written down any formal proposal for this but I do see a lot of value in exploring something like it in the future.</p>

<p>This was specifically something I rushed past at the start, and kept bumping into issues trying to do things. Seeing other peoples solutions to the AoC puzzles I was working on was a massive help to see different ways to do the same thing. I think I had to slow down and spend some time playing with Result and Task building different programs to get comfortable with it.</p>
