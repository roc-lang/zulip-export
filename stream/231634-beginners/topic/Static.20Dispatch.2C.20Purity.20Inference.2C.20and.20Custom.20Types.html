<p>I am extremely excited about all three of these proposals, and was curious about a roadmap tracking the progress of these?</p>
<p>I know there is mention of freezing the current iteration of Roc, and was wondering the approach about implementing these proposals via a dedicated feature branch?  Have they been pretty much finalized?</p>
<p>What is ROC's approach to version control long term regarding introducing breaking changes in the future?  I think for better adoption, conversion scripts might be needed if people are using ROC in production (which I think is going to happen a lot once these proposals are implemented)</p>

<p>We are doing our best to provide migration scripts for the things that we can - I've done that for both the move to snake_case identifiers and the new parens-and-comma calling syntax</p>

<p>Purity inference has already been implemented in the language by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="489294">@Agus Zubiaga</span> , it works really well (better than Tasks). We already have pre-releases for <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/releases/tag/0.18.0">basic-cli</a>, <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-webserver/releases/tag/0.11.0">basic-webserver</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/basic-ssg/releases/tag/0.6.0">basic-ssg</a>, we just need to fix an <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/pull/292">issue with Hyper</a> and then they're good to merge. <a href="https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-ray">roc-ray</a> is already released with Purity Inference. </p>
<p>So yeah, you can already use it with these platforms, we just need a little bit longer and then we'll be making an announcement for it then. Maybe a few days? No promises. We'll have an upgrade guide</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is ROC's approach to version control long term regarding introducing breaking changes in the future?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently we are pre versioned releases. As such, the release strategy is pretty minor. Generally speaking, when breaking changes are incoming, we:</p>
<ol>
<li>temporarily change nightly release to be <code>testing</code> instead of <code>latest</code> release. So downloading the <code>latest</code> will get the version before any breaking changes.</li>
<li>We submit the breaking changes directly in the roc main branch</li>
<li>We update at a minimum basic-cli, basic-webserver, and basic-ssg. We also try to update examples and tutorials</li>
<li>We go back to just having a <code>latest</code> release.</li>
</ol>
<p>If possible, we leave features around that enable old code to keep running. For example, <code>Task</code> still works for now despite purity inference being ready to go.</p>

<p>They get implemented directly to main via PRs. Occasionally, they get delayed a little before submitting to batch breaking changes and deal with the release cycle above.</p>

<p>I have started work on static dispatch and custom types as part of my effort to rewrite canonicalization. In short, the canonicalization is some of the oldest code in the Roc repo, and we want to improve its performance and cache-friendliness by first canonicalizing modules in silos without any knowledge of any other Roc code. This makes the new <code>roc_can_solo</code> produce deterministic output that is later recombined in <code>roc_can_combine</code> (name is WIP) kind of like linking objects into a binary.</p>
<p>There are lots of changes we want to do in addition to that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Static dispatch</li>
<li>Custom types</li>
<li>Move lambda set compilation to a future compiler pass</li>
</ul>
<p>To that end, I've been pushing to "run in a straight line" here: if we were to try to make all of these changes incrementally on top of the canonicalization rewrite, it'd take a whole lot longer. So we're doing it all in one go to get it to users faster. That will involve a big code switch at some point which means that writing Roc will look a lot different all at once. The hope is that around that time, Roc will be close to the shape we want it to be in the medium-term, so it's not so bad to make the breaks. After that, we'll try a lot harder to maintain stability to attract people to using Roc</p>

<p>I don't yet have a branch published because of the scale of the change. My approach here is to get a rough draft of what the changes will look like by machete'ing what code makes sense until I can finish writing down a plain-English guide of what the code will do. I'll then be trying to break it up into as reasonable-to-code-review chunks as I can. I'll try to make the branch public as soon as I think it at all resembles what we want to do in the future</p>

<p>Hello, I came to this Zulip wondering essentially the same things <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="676210">@Brian Teague</span> asked back in January. These features are super exciting to see! I'm wondering 1) how far along are these things (still planned for later this year?) and 2) for something like static dispatch, is it even possible to have any sort of automatic re-writing tools to migrate from code that used abilities to the new approach? 3) <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="461444">@Sam Mohr</span> Have you ended up making the branch you're working on public or is it not visible for now?</p>

<p>HI <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="942556">@Hubbard Joppa</span>,<br>
1) Purity inference is done. Static dispatch and custom types will be implemented in the new compiler, not sure how far along those are right now. I believe we expect to be done with those by the end of the year.<br>
2) Sounds like a job for a large language model :)</p>
