<p>I have  this funny thought that exactly one year ago I started  my very short journey with Haskell. I was not  able to get any kind of proficiency unfortunately. What  I think  is that  Haskell has  good and honest  fundamentals but it is carried away by hubris. From time to time I have  Haskell videos recommended, so I see. People  are inventive give them tools they will harm themself, c++ is like that, Haskell is like that. Roc  fortunately is  not yet there, it is easy  to  use  environment wise (Haskell ecosystem I find just hostile ), in general it i easy to use  syntax  wise (again Haskell is just hostile),  in Roc  it is difficult to create  something  crazy  syntax  wise  ("C"  is  ideal in that respect ). So  overall what  I like to convey is the  hope, that  things  will stay that way. I hope  that  the  language  will never by swallowed  by hubris  like (c++, Haskell etc.). If it stays on it's current trajectory, I am next co certain that it will see  wider  adaptation  at  some point, it is just to good to be ignored..</p>

<p>Having messed Haskell for about two years I have to say my only real friction in the beginning was missing an easy IDE UX which made analyzing errors much slower, which later got resolved with VS Code plugin. I support your sentiment on Roc, just wanted to encourage some more time with Haskell if there is a room for that =)<br>
Personally, after watching Richard's interviews I am confident his opinionated approach will ensure Roc will gain features while remaining accessible and non-bloated, which is going to be a fantastic boost for FP in a lot of projects, finally!</p>

<p>I think the problem starts with  features, let's compare C and C++. C as it stands today is still good language. (It is good within its niche, low memory microcontrollers, so I would not use it outside of this domain necessarily) <br>
What  makes it so good ? In my opinion it has  only features required for low level  job, few  abstraction and memory access. This is basically what I need in practice.  When I am working with C  code I can in one day become quite familiar  with inner workings of given piece of  functionality. I attribute it to the fact that  it is not so easy to abuse, such a simple  language. And yeah people still try to abuse it.  Sometimes macro fixated  developers makes  things a little bit messier  but the  language prevents it by design in general.<br>
 Fortunately for  C , C++ came  along and all "ingenuity" went there. So as  of  today  while C  is  still lean and effective, C++ transformed into ugly multi paradigm  hybrid. In my opinion it is broken beyond repair, and  should be dropped by industry whenever possible. There  exists just too many ways in which I can screw  my code. C++ almost encourages that. Before you notice  the  code  became  horrible pile of templates, lambdas  and  object oriented abstractions used  at random. It just  pure pain at some point. I ask myself why I even  deal with that? For me programming  suppose to be  fun, not  pain for  no reason.  Efficiency  drops, code  quality drops everything  gravitates  toward  huge buggy  mess. I  put the blame  on language here. Allowing  to much  freedom by adding  contradicting highly redundant features,  does not  benefit  anybody.And  again  I am asking  why ? What war  we are  fighting  here?  <br>
  There is only  so many  problems I could realistically try to solve. Provide me friendly well crafted toolset, just  for  that and I will be  happy. <br>
Python works  in that regard but for me it is soulless not fun at all, especially if I dive into some  kind of algorithmic job. Roc  as it is today  stands out. Capabilities are there I can solve my  problems  and  have  fun  at the same  time.It would be great if  the  language could  somehow avoid  fate of C++ and stay  just  that  good,  fun, high level  language</p>

<p>I think the design goals of roc include simplicity of the roc language, so it's unlikely to fall into the traps of ever more esoteric abstractions that befall haskell. The fundamental ingredients of the roc language itself have learned the lessons of mistakes in the haskell standard library and from the bulletproof basics library of roc's parent leakage elm, so there aren't footguns away from <code>crash</code> (which you can always achieve by exceeding the capacity of your int or dividing by zero). Also, the separation of platform from application code means that if some new, better way to structure your code comes along, like the Elm architecture is better than FRP (which is again better than imperative ui), then no one needs to update the language, you can just release a new package with the simpler, better way of doing things. I see a lot of promise in the roc language. A lot.</p>
