<p>I'm interested in learning all the necessities for platform creation.</p>
<p>Since it seems the IO binding of a platform have to come from something else, I thought it'd be interesting to make a Tauri-like platform for Roc. Since Tauri is, by itself, a pre-built fusion of Tao and Wry, I was wondering about utilizing Tao and Wry as parts of a Rust platform for Roc, and of course incorporating all the other platform essentials too.</p>
<p>And since the tutorials on platforms doesn't quite exist yet, I figured I'd ask here for some pointers while I peruse the examples</p>

<p>Basic CLI is a good base to learn how a rust platform works. Definitely try to use glue if possible (makes it less likely to hit segfaults and such). Also, definitely ask questions as you get into implementation.</p>

<p>Also, what are tao, wry, and tauri? Do you have a quick link with explanation?</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao">Tao</a> is a window-creation thing, and <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry">Wry</a> is a webview renderer. They come together in <a href="https://tauri.app/">Tauri</a> to create a nice alternative to Electron. On Windows, it unfortunately still derives from Chromium/Edge, I think. But on Linux and Mac it uses Webkit.</p>

<p>The irony is I'm looking to make this platform to delay learning Rust as much as possible, but by making this platform, I'm likely going to have to learn Rust <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span></p>

<p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/examples/gui">gui example</a> that currently uses wgpu. I think maybe <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="361169">@Anton</span>  or <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281383">@Richard Feldman</span> wrote it?? with the view to build the Roc editor (which is still planned but currently a lower priority). </p>
<p>I have been thinking it would be great if that was split out into another platform (maybe basic-graphics) or something. I think I could help clean it up to use glue to generate the types instead of how it is currently implemented (it was written long before glue gen existed). That might serve as a good example for this project. I have completed a similar transformation for basic-webserver which probably is the best example of this currently. I have a branch for basic-cli to upgrade that to use glue gen (I can't remember what the issue is there).</p>
<p>With the current glue and some (minor) workarounds I think we already have all the parts to build cross-platform gui applications using Roc and wgpu.</p>

<p>I know of the existance of <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/examples/platform-switching/">this</a>, which has a c-platform in it, but can't tell you more on it. Never even opened it to look at before.</p>
