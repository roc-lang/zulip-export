<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I just discovered Roc a few minutes ago so I don't know much about it besides what was mentioned in the Youtube video uploaded by Developer Voices. But I had a question that I was hoping someone here with more experience could answer.</p>
<p>At some point in the distant future I would like to make a video game that allows its users to write code to interact with the world. It will be in Rust via the Bevy engine. Does it make sense to use Roc for this scenario? There were some things mentioned in the video that made me think it might be great.</p>
<p>What I would need is something that can quickly execute and compile small pieces of code. it doesn't need to be as fast as Rust, but I don't want it to be orders of magnitude slower either. It would also be fun if the users could do this in an online multiplayer environment, so sandboxing would be critical.</p>
<p>edit: I realize that there are many other solutions I could look into, but I was wondering how easy/ergonomic it would be relative to those solutions. So it would be great to know of any difficulties or pitfalls with a possible Roc implementation. That way I can perhaps make comparisons with the other solutions</p>

<p>Okay, so I expected there to be topics on using Roc with Rust, but I didn't bother to look deeper to see if there were any bevy mentions in here, lol. Small world. Or bevy is bigger deal than I thought. In my defense, nothing came up when i looked up "bevy". I guess it was just looking at topic names.</p>

<p>Oh hold on. So if my host doesn't provide a way to change files or access the internet, Roc apps will simply not be able to do that. So my host can be the sandbox by design. Is that correct?</p>

<p>I'm really not used to that. It makes too much sense lol.</p>
<p>I think I'll just give it a shot with making a host for Bevy and if I have any questions il post them here. But I'm already aware of some issues because in the past I actually did <strong><em>some</em></strong> research into integrating a runtime in Bevy for user-made script and I did not get very far :/ .</p>

<p>Gonna post here for now, <a class="stream" data-stream-id="302903" href="/#narrow/stream/302903-Writing-a-platform">#Writing a platform</a> feels like a place for more intelligent conversation <span aria-label="rolling on the floor laughing" class="emoji emoji-1f923" role="img" title="rolling on the floor laughing">:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:</span>.</p>
<p>So I'm looking at a <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/examples/glue/rust-platform/src/lib.rs">simple rust platform</a> and it looks like a good place to start because its not super big but I'm not sure what the important files are and what anything means. There is very little documentation. If someone could go through it and put some comments in there, it would be a lot of help. If I missed something, please post a link. For now here is my interpretation of what I see:</p>
<p>main.roc looks important, it looks like a platform definition file. No clue whats going on there. A breakdown of what everything does would be nice.</p>
<p>The file that seems to be the bulk of the platform is <code>lib.rs</code>. it has functions like roc_realloc and roc_dealloc. Are all of these roc_ functions expected to exist in every platform? And are the ones in <code>lib.rs</code> gonna lead to memory leaks or any other memory management bugs? I was under the impression that the platform would need to do a bit more in terms of memory management, but it seems to me that Roc just needs a basic API to execute memory related tasks, such as allocating and deallocating, and Roc will just take it from there. I don't know if this is true though, but it is my current read of the situation. If that's true, then that's actually great news for me because I was anxious about how the memory management stuff was going to work and this seems very doable. Obviously for my case I still need to provide an API to deal with Bevy specific things, but my hope is that I wont have to write any unsafe blocks with memory management that I wont be able to effectively audit.</p>
<p>The last thing is rust_main. Im confused about what the implementation means in general for platform development. I imagined that the platform is just a Roc API with a non-Roc implementation. If a Roc app uses something from the Roc API, it actually executes code in the host language without needing to know about it. And when you create variables in the Roc App that require heap memory, im assuming roc_alloc gets called automatically without the user needing to know about it. Thats all cool, but rust_main seems to be iterating through the roc app and resolving "discriminants". But my expectation was that I wouldn't need to run code in a loop like this, and instead just provide a specific function signature, similar to how we roc_alloc is defined. So I guess my question here is: what role does rust_main play? Would I need to do something similar in my case?</p>

<p>That probably isn't a good example to base off of today because it is using trying to use effect interpreters (the discriminant and switch in rust main that you noted). I'm not sure the best starting point to look at though. Probably <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="515757">@Luke Boswell</span> knows the best base for a rust platform with glue, maybe basic CLI, but it is pretty large now and would need a lot of trimming.</p>

<p>Yeah, I feel kinda bad for all the people working on platforms or interested rn. We are in a gap where a lot of things are planned (some in progress) that will be pretty big changes to exactly how platforms work. So currently documentation is low priority cause it will be stale very fast. Also, currently tooling is only ok, but still has gaps.</p>
<p>Hopefully medium term we will be transitioned with glue that just works and better docs, but there is a solid chunk of work to get there (just in platform impl changes before we even get to the glue or docs work)</p>

<p>I can't speak for everyone, but I really appreciate the work that you and other contributors do for cool projects like these, and I wouldn't want you to feel bad about something that is just a natural part of development. I am willing to wait longer if I need to, so no sweat!</p>
<p>I don't want to seriously touch this until Bevy releases their dynamic querying and system registration (which will happen in 3-9 months by my estimation). For now I just wanted to try to learn whatever I can out of curiosity.</p>

<p>Regarding platforms, I think basic-webserver is probably the most mature re glue. But there are some papercuts and workarounds to get it to work. Definitely not a reflection of the desired end state, but just workable enough to save writing a bunch of glue for basic types.</p>

<p>Right now I'm just trying to assess the viability of Roc for Bevy, so just thinking about it I guess. Luke and Alexander are working on something and I plan to join the effort at some point once I have caught up with their work, but I don't know where that path will lead so I'm also thinking about how I would go about this myself.</p>

<p>Okay so i looked at the basic-webserver. In my case, the data  type id be sending into mainForHost is not knowable by the platform. Well, at least not during compile time. Let me explain...</p>
<p>I might try to implement the following design: each user-made script must provide at least 2 functions: run() and query(). The query function will return something representing the data to query in the Bevy world. So the platform would first run roc_app::query() and then use the result to query the world, and then pass that data into roc_app::run(), which could be anything, but it should be the same types found in the query. Is this something that would be doable? Roc is statically typed, but that should be fine on the Roc side because once the user creates the script and it compiles, it wont need to change again during runtime. But as the author of the platform, I wont be able to know what query() will return (on the rust side I bet we would be dealing with generics). This also means I wont know the data type to pass into run(). </p>
<p>Has someone run into this kind of situation before?</p>

<p>Using dynamic types over ffi definitely adds a layer of complication. In general, there are a handful of options here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Probably the easiest answer is to use tagged types. So everything that is passed from roc into rust would be in a form that describes the data. Rust would then dynamically deal with this info at runtime. This is would would happen in the case of lua or python being embedded in a generic way. That said, it obviously has a runtime cost.</li>
<li>This next option is very use case specific as to whether or not it can be applied. First, you make all the data that roc is passing back to the host opaque. The host will receive what it thinks is a <code>Box {}</code>. Aka a pointer to nothing. Obviously the pointer will be to real roc data. When the host needs to interact with the boxed data, it needs to a generic method in roc to do so. For example, it might store arbitrary roc data and then call an update and render method on that data in roc. Could also use a <code>List {}</code> on the host side or similar if you want the data densely packed. But in general, this puts more responsibility on roc and likely more ffi communication and maybe more boxing.</li>
<li>Last option would be the most complicated, but it would be to always compile the platform for the specific instance of the application. You would write the the platform using generics in rust. When compiling the roc app, each compilation would modify the platform and regenerate glue or have some other for of autogenerated rust code to deal with the generics. This has the potentially to be highest performance because it keeps everything static always. That said, it is much more complicated to manage and always requires the platform on an application data type changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, I would lean towards 2 if you can make it work, if not probably 1 is best currently, but 3 would be really cool to see. But I would guess the cost isn't worth it especially for starting exploration.</p>

<p>For option 1, could caching eliminate the runtime cost? I don't expect the types to change often. Actually, they should only change when the user changes them during some kind of dev session (imagining a hot reloading situation with script editing inside the game) but once they're in "game mode" i can guarantee that the types they ask for will never change.</p>

<p>I would have to think about it more and what exactly gets cached, but I think if you were to cache the type information, you might still have more complex/dynamic code, than fully static, but it should be a reasonable speed.</p>

<p>Maybe we made some changes and didnt update that script. Its not exactly checked in CI or anything. Also I cant remember but the glue that is generated may also have some minor tweaks by hand. I think we had an issue with generating invalid assert statements that can just be commented out.</p>

<p>So I was trying to get the glue example to work and I was getting errors when trying to run the app so i just listened to the error and made the changes to the generated glue. Surprisingly, it actually allowed the app to run! Unfortunately, I got this runtime error:</p>

<p>Does StdoutWrite take a closure? If so, it also can't have clone (need to follow all the way up the chain). That said, not sure why it would take a closure currently. Should just be an FX function that takes a string and returns nothing.</p>

<p>Yeah, platforms are in a state where they are possible to make, but definitely hobbled together/require specific knowledge to make correctly. So it requires more effort to figure out the nuances.</p>
