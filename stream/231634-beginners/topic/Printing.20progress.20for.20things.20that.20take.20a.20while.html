<p>When I have a function that takes a while (not because of IO or whatever, just computation), is it possible to output something to the console when that function runs? I know about "dbg", but that doesn't do anything when running the binary, only when running "roc dev".</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>processRange: Nat, Nat -&gt; Nat
processRange = \start, length -&gt;
  Stdout.line &quot;Processing range: \(start) - \(start+length-1)&quot;
  somethingThatTakesLongToCompute start length
</code></pre></div>
<p>I haven't been able to find any syntax that makes Stdout.line work in a function other than main, maybe it's not possible? Am I doing this wrong? There should be some way to indicate to the user that the program is still running, just working on whatever task it's been given, right?</p>

<p>For <code>Stdout.line</code> to work in an arbitrary function, that function would need to be changed to return a <code>Task</code></p>

<p>Yes, that would be some extra juggling since there is really no <em>other</em> need to change the type of that function than to be able to report progress to a user waiting for the result. It would just be nice to be able to provide an ETA or some indication that something is still happening while long computations run.</p>

<p>For example, right now I'm running something that might take minutes, hours or days and I have no idea which unless I can see some progress. In "roc dev" it will take days, for sure, but --optimize speeds things up a lot so it may be only hours in that case but I have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>I'll try and see if I can type-juggle that Task into the function. What I'm doing is probably wrong since I didn't expect it to take anywhere near this long, I was hoping for seconds.</p>

<p>I would break the input into chunks and print an update after each chunk is processed.</p>

<p>So now I have a <code>List (Task Nat *)</code> that I'd like to each await, get the result and do something with the resulting list of results. I'm trying to <code>List.map</code> using <code>Task.await</code> and I'm not getting anywhere. Probably because that's not how things are done in Roc.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>main =
    ranges
    |&gt; List.map \range -&gt; searchRange range
    |&gt; List.map \task -&gt; await task ???
    |&gt; List.min
    |&gt; Task.ok

searchRange : Range -&gt; Task Nat *
searchRange = range -&gt;
      {} &lt;- (Stdout.line &quot;Searching range \(Num.toStr range.start) \(Num.toStr range.length)&quot;) |&gt; await
    somethingThatTakesALongTime range |&gt; Task.ok
</code></pre></div>
<p>Is it possible to wrap the awaiting of a bunch of tasks into another task that can then process the results of each of the smaller tasks?</p>

<p>Took me a while and I had to sprinkle <code>await</code> and <code>Task.ok</code> everywhere until it compiled, but I finally did manage to get it working with Task.loop, thanks! It's still taking way too long, but that's just because my implementation is slow. I did manage to print status updates while the computation is running.</p>
