<p>I was talking to a friend about <code>roc-pg</code> and the topic came up that the world needs a type-safe data frame library. Tbh I've never really used a data frame lirbary (e.g. Python's pandas) so this question may not make a lot of sense. But, from what was explained tome it sounded like a use-case that Roc could be well-suited for.</p>
<p>Is there anything fundamental that would prevent Roc from having a really ergonomic data frame experience in future?</p>

<p>I guess the basic idea is an opaque type that stores 2D data, supports operations like grouping, filtering, etc to produce new data frames.</p>

<p>Yes, I've thought this too back when I was working a lot with pandas.<br>
This also seems like a good fit for plugins.</p>
<p>The way I imagine that this could work is that you have an LLM detect appropriate types for each column and have it generate custom parsers where necessary to convert the strings to those types. A plugin could be used to handle the data that fails to parse, it could be corrected, labeled as missing, or the whole row could be deleted.</p>
<p>pandas does not make good use of the available hardware, it's not multi-threaded while dataframe operations are often embarrassingly parallel. pandas also does not handle the available memory intelligently, it will gladly spend a long time filling up your memory while it could easily predict that the dataframe it's constructing from a file will not fit in your memory.</p>
<p>With the potential for speed and efficiency in Roc as well as our attention for UX we could indeed make an excellent dataframe library.</p>

<p>Yes, I totally agree! If people want to learn about data frames, I recommend looking at <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html">dplyr</a>, which is very popular in R and has a nice functional API. (R has its quirks, but I think people underestimate it.)</p>
<p>Also, here’s a <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/bgreenma/publications/table-types/lgk-pj-2022.pdf">paper</a> I found interesting that describes some of the challenges of typing data frames. They made a <a href="https://github.com/brownplt/B2T2">“benchmark for table types”</a> that includes common data frame operations so people can compare how well their language can support typing them.</p>

<p>One thing i find interesting here is that a lot of data framed are noisy in terms of types. That is what makes them hard to work with. Naturally, i think dynamic languages are well suited in that they often can flexibly do things with data of different types. That said, often they do the wrong thing or crash due to wrong types. A dynamic language that properly had hooks to help you deal with wrong types probably would be very well suited.</p>
<p>That said, with a simple tag union type and doing the work to wrap everything, a typed language can do quite well. I think it has some wins and some losses. Obvious win is that it forces you to deal with all possible types. Obvious loss, dealing with all types is a pain and often a big loss in terms of perf. A jited dynamic language can optimize for the single expected type and essential recover via exceptions if it hits an unexpected type. That can be a huge perf gain if your data through certain functions is mostly regular.</p>
<p>I feel like true messy data frames are case where you both do and don't want types. But this is from pretty old and limited experience.</p>

<p>I've also thought about what a dataframes library would look like in Roc. I don't think there's been a dataframes library that takes advantage of static types yet, but I think there's reasons why it hasn't been attempted/suceeded.</p>
<div class="spoiler-block"><div class="spoiler-header">
<p>I wrote a long and rambling thing about dataframe libraries here, read at your own peril</p>
</div><div class="spoiler-content" aria-hidden="true">
<p>Some background, I was a data scientist and am now a data engineer, I've used R/dplyr for about 5 years, Python/Pandas for 2 years, and Julia/DataFrames.jl for 4, with most of those years overlapping. I switched to data engineering partly because I was slightly disillusioned with the field of data science, so keep that in mind if you carry on reading. If you're interested in why, I read a blogpost a while ago that echoed my thoughts closely. I can't find it now, but it was similar to <a href="https://ryxcommar.com/2022/11/27/goodbye-data-science/">this one</a>.</p>
<p>The typical users of a dataframe library are data analysts or data scientists. The most common workflow I've seen is opening a Jupyter notebook, reading data from a CSV or JSON file and then executing commands one by one and looking at the output to explore the data. This kind of exploration requires an intuitive and powerful UX. Your ability to quickly clean and then transform the data is the highest priority, the cleanness of your code isn't that important because it will only be run once to get the summary table or plots. The kinds of bugs that static types can catch are normally not relevant here because of the very quick feedback loop, you might want to clean up a column by transforming it somehow, and if you misremember the type of the column you'll see the mistake almost instantly in the output of that cell. The other kinds of bugs that static types can mitigate are correctness bugs, but to be honest, as a data scientist there was never much pressure for the analyses to be correct, it's a lot of gut and vibes, and at the end of the day as long as the output seems plausible nobody ever checks it for correctness.</p>
<p>The other users of dataframe libraries are the engineers who are tasked with taking an analyst's jupyter notebook and productionising it into a dashboard or a generated report. These kinds of users care more about clean, correct and fast code, so might be more open to using Roc. The thing is, these kinds of tasks are mostly done in data warehouses nowadays like Snowflake or Clickhouse where you can only use SQL. SQL is a great tool for writing these data pipelines, the syntax sucks, but the declarative nature means it's great for transforming data.</p>
<p>I think writing a dataframes library in Roc would eat up a lot of time, all of the existing solutions have had a lot of effort put into making them fast, see <a href="https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/">these benchmarks</a>. Maybe one takeaway from those benchmarks is how fast Julia's DataFrames.jl is. Most other dataframe libraries are written in languages without a GC (polars in Rust, Clickhouse in C++, data.table in C, pandas in C/C++), but Julia is GC'd and uses LLVM like Roc, so in theory performance of a Roc dataframe library could be very good.</p>
<p>In terms of getting inspiration, I can't stand the pandas API. It's so incredibly inconsistent and unergonomic, I have to look up the syntax for every operation each time I use it. Dplyr is the best in terms of ergonomics 99&amp; of the time, but its heavy reliance on metaprogramming means in 1% of cases it blows up with an extremely unhelpful error message. Julia's DataFrames.jl feels closer to the Roc philosophy by being much more explicit than dplyr and having a small, curated list of functions compared with dplyr's massive list of features. The closest to what I imagine a Roc dataframe library being is probably Rust's polars, which is what Elixir's Explorer uses under the hood. I've not used it in Rust, but in Python the syntax feels very verbose and quite strange, it barely uses any native Python features and is basically its own DSL. I imagine if I learnt that DSL it would be nice to use, and it's rediculously fast (see the benchmarks above).</p>
</div></div>
<p>Having said all that, I would still like to see what a dataframes library in Roc would look like. The key thing I'd like is to take advantage of Roc's type checker to typecheck the types of the columns, I believe this is something that not even polars does, the only example I know of is Julia's <code>TypedTables.jl</code>, but Julia can't be statically type checked, so it doesn't take advantage of this fact.</p>
<p>I thought about trying to rewrite one of my analyses in Roc using a list of records as a kind of basic dataframe to see how far I could get, but the first step in this analysis was to loop over every column to rename it, which wouldn't be possible with that data structure. Instead, this morning I looked at the API for <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/owl/">Ocaml's Owl</a> and started writing my own library in Roc. I made a Dataframe type which is an opaque wrapper for a list of series, and a series is a union of a bunch of different series types, and each series is an opaque wrapper around a list and a string for the series' name. I used a Python script to generate each series type. I gave up after trying to write an example app using the library I wrote and getting some compiler errors that I didn't understand.</p>
<p>Here's the repo for my experiment: <a href="https://github.com/Hasnep/roc-dataframes">https://github.com/Hasnep/roc-dataframes</a></p>

<p>Oh, my brother just pointed out to me that implementing the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a> spec would probably be the best way of writing a dataframe library in Roc, but I believe Arrow's dataframes are dynamically typed, that's why polars doesn't typecheck the columns, so I think the experience of using Arrow in Roc would be just like a more verbose version of Elixir's Explorer.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="508951">@Hannes</span> Your comment makes a lot of sense to me. Just to add to the part about it being really hard, my vague understanding is that type-safe data frame libraries are still an open research problem in a lot of ways. I suspect a really good one would require a more powerful type system than Roc currently has. </p>
<p>Also, I don’t have any real experience using pandas, but I’m so glad to hear others confirm my feelings about its API! I don’t understand how it hasn’t been replaced by a nicer wrapper or something. Don’t even get me started on matplotlib (but again, not much experience).</p>

<p>Even if Roc had a dataframe library that didn't provide any typing advantages over the alternatives in other languages, I still think it would be better than not having one at all. I didn't use dplyr for data science stuff at all. I just used it to help me ingest product data at my e-commerce job because our PIM was terrible.  So if someone were building an e-commerce platform, ERP,  BI tool, etc., they could probably take advantage of such a library. And it would probably be painful to have to maintain a custom Roc platform just to gain access to fast data transformations. But perhaps for those use cases a custom platform would make sense anyway.</p>
