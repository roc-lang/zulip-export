<p>Would it be helpful to everyone if there was a site for generating docs for packages? This way package maintainers just have to add their repo and it would generate them automatically for each version. This could also help find packages.</p>
<p>Is something like this already planned officially or unofficially?</p>

<p>I've been using <a href="https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-json/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate-docs.yaml">this GH workflow</a> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="508951">@Hannes</span> put together which automatically generates the docs for my packages on each PR. </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the plan if for the centralised package index to include docs. But that hasn't been started on yet.</p>
<p>A centralised site with docs would be very helpful. </p>
<p>One idea in a similar direction, what if you could feed a list of package urls into <code>roc docs</code> and it generate that full site for you? Then you don't need to host anything. And it would include all of the modules for all of the packages.</p>
