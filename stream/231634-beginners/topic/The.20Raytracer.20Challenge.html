<p>Hi, I've started the implementing <a href="http://raytracerchallenge.com/">http://raytracerchallenge.com/</a> in roc, following the book.<br>
I'm also learning roc on the way (but I have some experience with Haskell and Elm).</p>
<p>Now the book gives you some tests in natural language-BDD style and you have to implement them.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Scenario: A tuple with w=1.0 is a point<br>
Given a ← tuple(4.3, -4.2, 3.1, 1.0)<br>
Then a.x = 4.3<br>
And a.y = -4.2<br>
And a.z = 3.1<br>
And a.w = 1.0<br>
And a is a point<br>
And a is not a vector</p>
<p>I implemented them as:</p>
<p>isVector = \v -&gt; v.w == 0.0<br>
isPoint = \p -&gt; p.w == 1.0</p>
<p>a = {x:4.3, y:-4.2, z:3.1, w:1.0}</p>
<p>expect isVector a == Bool.false<br>
expect isPoint a == Bool.true</p>
<p>Does this seem ok? </p>
<p>some other doubts I had so far:</p>
<p>Ideally I would like to separate tests from the code... but not sure if it's a good idea in roc.<br>
Would be a good idea to name my record type (x,y,z,w: I32?)? Opaque types seems the best choice to me but I'm not sure. </p>
<p>The doc and the tutorial and very good, and I didn't have any particular problem, but I really liked the Clojure Koans when learning Clojure and I wrote something similar for Kotlin years ago... maybe once I've finished my raytracer... :)</p>
<p>Btw I've started using IntelliJ as editor, because it's just convenient for me. I don't think there is a plugin for roc, but I may write one before long. :)</p>
<p>thanks to everybody for the effort and the great language, it's a lot of fun writing in roc!</p>

<p>Hi Uberto :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a = {x:4.3, y:-4.2, z:3.1, w:1.0}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the idiomatic Roc way would be:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>vectorOrPoint : [Vector, Point]
a = {x:4.3, y:-4.2, z:3.1, w: Point}
</code></pre></div>

</blockquote>
<p>Adding exercises to some <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/examples">examples</a> is something we've talked about in the past. Exercises make things stick :). In Roc it would be especially cool because you could complete them in the browser, just like we do with the web repl.</p>

<p>That would be awesome, fyi we have <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/crates/lang_srv">a language server</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/ivan-demchenko/roc-vscode-unofficial">vscode plugin</a> may be useful inspiration as well.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think we've ever done that but you should be able to make <a href="https://www.roc-lang.org/examples/MultipleRocFiles/README.html">an interface module</a> that imports the functions you want to test. I also made <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/examples/issues/143">an issue</a> in the examples repo to demonstrate how to do this.</p>

<p>thanks Anton, I will follow your suggestions and I'll keep posting things that makes me confused. :)</p>
