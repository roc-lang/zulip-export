<p>Just thought I would share something that we might want to look at. I have been writing a platform and I had a bug somewhere that took me quite a while to track down. In the end I realised that it was just that I was missing one of the double underscores in the <code>roc__renderForHost_1_exposed_generic</code>. I starred at that a while before I realised what was going on. Is there a reason we need the double? I know it helps with finding the symbol as it is different from other generated functions. Maybe we could use another pattern?</p>
