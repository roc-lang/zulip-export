<p>Hello.<br>
How to build SPA with Roc? I was using Elm previously.</p>
<p>I have found this for Elm programmers but can't find something about SPA <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/roc-for-elm-programmers.md">https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/roc-for-elm-programmers.md</a>.</p>
<p>I see that I can generate static website</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/www/main.roc">https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/www/main.roc</a></li>

</ul>
<p>I see there are platforms but no web platform? <a href="https://github.com/zraexy/roc/tree/main/examples/platform-switching">https://github.com/zraexy/roc/tree/main/examples/platform-switching</a></p>
<p>There is this project <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/examples/virtual-dom-wip">https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/examples/virtual-dom-wip</a> but I think it is going webassembly way and is also WIP.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>We don't have any SPA platforms yet but you can use Roc for the backend with the <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-webserver/blob/main/examples/todos.roc">basic-webserver platform</a>.</p>

<p>What would it take to modify the compiler to emit javascript instead of, say, llvm?<br>
The readme (<a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/crates/compiler/README.md">https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/crates/compiler/README.md</a>) lists a number of steps. Where, and what kind of changes are need to allow targeting javascript (or any other scripting lang)?</p>
<p>How to implement platforms when compiling to javascript is a different question. My main interest here is if it is possible at all, and if so how, too parse + convert Roc to javascript, turning Roc into a viable replacement for Elm</p>

<p>it's an explicit non-goal of the project to emit JavaScript, but if you wanted to try it yourself on a fork, the minimal change you'd need to make would be to add a new <code>gen_</code> crate (like <code>gen_llvm</code> or <code>gen_dev</code>) which would go from <code>mono::ir</code> to whatever output you wanted</p>

<p>A better (or maybe just easier) way to use Roc in the JS world would probably be for someone to create a platform that compiles to wasm and provides access to parts of the JS stdlib. Then you would load the wasm file in JS and hook up the wasm calls to JS calls. It would be weird but i think it would work, right?</p>

<p>Great! So someone just needs to write that hard coded JS file that exposes all of the effects in the JS stdlib and that's basically the same as compiling to JS <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span></p>

<p>Something I've always seen handwaved in wasm "code sharing" or the like is referential integrity. A lot of JavaScript optimizations rely on it and I worry that dropping a wasm bundle in would prevent any sort of "share you business logic using a roc module that your existing code can use" migration path</p>

<p>For sure, let's say that you have a mobile app and a web app and you want to share some logic in a common roc module (basically along the lines of kotlin multiplatform), elm won't run in a non-browser environment so I don't think that's an option.</p>

<p>Referential integrity is basical JavaScript's way of saying pointer comparisons. It is a common optimization to check object (essentially pointers to records) equality by just comparing the references themselves. If they reference the same object they are equal , or perhaps more importantly if they don't have the same reference you assume they are not equal</p>

<p>From what I understand of wasm, if I'm using any data inside of wasm from js-land then I have to marshall it across the wasm-boundary, and then if I return the data I would marshall it back across the boundary and end up with a different reference (and in this case most likely a deep copy), this would make it unusable in a lot of common js patterns.</p>

<p>This isn't a problem outside the browser because there doesn't have to be much marshalling to cross the C ffi. Presumably a platform could just "understand" a roc type and it's all good to go</p>

<p>I also think it is totally fine to say "swapping out a redux store in a react app for a roc module is not a use case we think is in scope". Just pointing out that there are reasons people like compile to js over wasm for some use cases</p>

<p>Yeah, I think that is a great strategy for when a whole slice of your ui is going to be in roc. I don't think it avoids the problems when you're embedding just logic into a react app.</p>

<p>For example a real use case we have at my company. We have a list of transactions that's 10s of thousands of times long. If I want to update a single transaction I need to send it all across and then update a value and send it  back. In order to use wasm I'd need to find a good "cutting point" to minimize the amount of serialize/deserialize I have to do. If it's just js I can plug it in way easier</p>

<p>Given how roc handles effects, I think it will always have some complex edges in this area. Fundamentally a good "cutting point" is required to use roc in general. That is what a platform hopefully is.</p>

<p>I do agree that wasm makes this more complex. For this cutting point, you might:</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to store the full list of transactions in wasm. Then just reference it from the js side. That would be avoid serialization.</li>
<li>Give roc effects that let it read and write individual elements in the list of transactions. That way you only ever pay the cost of a small conversion at a time. You never need an extra copy of this data in memory.</li>
<li>Just pay the cost but do things in larger blocks in roc. That way the cost isn't a big deal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these might mitigated the issue, but fundamentally, performance would need to be measured.</p>

<p>I find them pretty nice! There are some rough edges and oddities to roc for me still, but building the client side interaction in the element attributes feels good. Having a server side elm-like language is amazing, and the unexpected bumps are an indication of the promising future. You'd already done the hard work with the sqlite stuff, so I just had to write a query and use your existing connection, so I don't feel like I can comment on that too much, but it does seem like a good choice.</p>

<p>Sorry about the formatting changes in my PR. The roc formatter is set to auto format when I save. I probably should have tried to isolate that to a single commit, or turned it off. But I wasn't intending to make a PR when I started messing around, I just wanted to see if I could get it to run, and then wanted to see if I could add a feature. It was only when I'd finished that I thought I should make a PR out of it.</p>
