<p>Hi all! I've been trying my hand at building a roc platform to emulate the Elm architecture to some degree, closely following what other established platforms do.</p>
<p>I've managed to get to a point where the roc app can talk to the host code, but here I started running into memory issues. I've been trying to use valgrind to debug this, but aside from several courses many years ago I don't have much experience w/ these types of problems.</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone has some books or resources they could recommend that would help shed some light on this for me. Preferably that would be most helpful in the context of Roc &amp; unsafe rust, rather than being a good C developer.</p>
<p>Also, if anyone has any suggestions or ideas of what my problem could be, code is at <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~parasrah/roc-platform-repro/tree/SH-1/unaligned-tcache-chunk">https://git.sr.ht/~parasrah/roc-platform-repro/tree/SH-1/unaligned-tcache-chunk</a>, and the error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk detected<br>
Aborted (core dumped)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you!</p>
