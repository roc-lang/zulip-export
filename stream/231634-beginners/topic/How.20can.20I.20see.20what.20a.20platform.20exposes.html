<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I wonder how I can find what I can import into my App from a chosen platform. I expected to see that in the <code>expose</code> list of the platform, but in most cases this is empty. (e.g. cli-platform) So probably there is an other mechanism right? I searched the docs and zulip for an answer but couldn't find any. <br>
Can anybody point me to the right direction or give me a quick answer? :) </p>
<p>thx</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="479080">@Rene Mailaender</span>,<br>
Yes, the exposes list is actually the intended place but we <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/pull/22#issuecomment-1488445151">still have a bug when using it</a>. You can find the list of exposed modules for basic-cli <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/pull/22/files">here</a>.</p>

<p>thx <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="361169">@Anton</span> <br>
I'm curious, how does roc actually know what a platform exposes in it's current state? Does it silently expose everything. So would my app be able to use e.g. <code>InnerTask</code>?</p>

<p>Another thing is you should be able to generate the docs for a platform with <code>roc docs /path/to/platform/main.roc</code>. It doesn't work for basic-cli with that bug rn. But that would be another way to see what is exposed. I assume package authors would also host docs somewhere for users in future for popular packages. I was wondering if this assumption is correct though. Would it be reasonable to use github pages for example?</p>

<p>I think so, with the <a href="#narrow/stream/304902-show-and-tell/topic/GitHub.20workflow.20to.20deploy.20docs.20to.20GitHub.20Pages/near/345571701">github action</a> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="508951">@Hannes</span> made that should be pretty easy</p>

<p>so the goal is:</p>
<ul>
<li>platforms only expose what's in their <code>exposes</code> list (currently docs respect this, but imports in general ignore it and allow importing anything from platforms - that's a bug!)</li>
<li>anyone can generate docs locally, both for platforms as well as packages in general (and if they want to, they can host them somewhere too of course)</li>
<li>long-term we additionally have a package manager which hosts everything, so you can just publish your package and it will generate and host docs etc</li>
</ul>

<p>thx for your answers! :) <br>
it seems for some reason the doc generation doesn't work. it only generates 3 files: favicon, styles.css and search.js. That doesn't seem right, right? <br>
I'm using:  roc nightly pre-release, built from commit 424b4aa on Fr 31 Mär 2023 09:08:14 UTC<br>
and i tried different *.roc files. Some of my own, some from roc/examples. roc never complains. in the terminal, everything seems right. </p>
<p>Is there a concept of how to generate docs for a remote (installed from an url) package/platform?</p>

<p>I think this occurs when the exposes list in the header is empty in the main.roc. Was that the case for your tests?</p>

<p>In general I think you should be able to do this using the path to which the package is downloaded, so: <code>roc docs /home/username/.cache/roc/packages/github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/releases/download/0.3.1/97mY3sUwo433-pcnEQUlMhn-sWiIf_J9bPhcAFZoqY4/main.roc</code> but for basic-cli this will not work due to <a href="https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/pull/22">this issue</a>.</p>

yes I know. :) </p>

hmm I thought so. </p>

<p>are there any plans/ideas doing something like: <code>roc docs ./myApp/main.roc</code> to generate not only the docs for my app, but for all used packages and the platform together? I think rust does something similar, or am i wrong? </p>
<p>btw It's not meant as a complaint or something like that. I know roc is in an early stage. I'm just interested, not only in it's current state but in future ideas too. So if the answer for future ideas on this topic is, there are none, that's totally fine. ;) </p>
<p>you all helped me a lot already. so thank you. :)</p>
