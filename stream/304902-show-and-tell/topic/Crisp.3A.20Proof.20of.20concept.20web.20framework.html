<p>I made a proof of concept web framework <a href="https://github.com/KilianVounckx/crisp">crisp</a>. It is based on gleam's web framework wisp.<br>
I like to play around with roc to see what you can build from its minimal design. It's really cool what you can do with it.<br>
Once I saw the wisp web framework and how it uses the <code>use</code> expression in gleam, I knew there could be a similar library in roc with backpassing. Since I'm a student with exams coming up, I don't have much time to work on it, but I do think this api has potential. Especially the middleware api with backpassing</p>
