If the size and alignment is the same, then Roc could in place manipulate the record.</p>\n<p>If an inplace mutation is not possible, then I think the argument, that a copy is so bad, is an weak argument. If it would be true, then Roc should also not support <code>List.map</code>. When I see it correctly, then <code>List.map</code> has the same performance problem. It has to do a copy, if the old size is not the same as the new size. For example in  <code>0u8 |&gt; List.repeat 100 |&gt; List.map Num.toU64</code>. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, the ergonomic of an update syntax is massive. If you have a record with many fields you currently have to change the type of one field, then it is very annoying to write out all of the 20 fields.</p>\n<p>The performance of  writing out all fields is probably worse then an update-syntax, because Roc can probably not make the inplace mutation, if the new size of the record is the same.</p>\n<p>Maybe you could reconsider your argument and think about adding support of changing the type of a record with the update syntax?</p>",
