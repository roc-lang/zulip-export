We have many asserts enabled in the debug compiler that can alert you to something going wrong. When building from source, build the debug compiler with <code>cargo build --bin roc</code>, the binary is at roc/target/debug/roc. When using roc through a nix flake like in <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli\">basic-cli</a>, use <code>rocPkgs.cli-debug</code> instead of <code>rocPkgs.cli</code></p>\n</blockquote>",
