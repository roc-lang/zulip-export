I don't understand what it should do from its type signature <code>updater : List elem, Int -&gt; { elem, new : elem -&gt; List elem }</code></li>\n<li>Any reason the functions use <code>Int</code> for the index? Shouldn't they use <code>Nat</code>?</li>\n</ul>",

If they end up being complex, better separate</p>\n<p>Int vs Nat: yeah, should be Nat</p>\n<p>Function signature: i have stared at it for a bit, and my gut feeling is that we probably want to change the signature. That said, i think i get it now. it takes a list and an index. It returns the element at that index. It also returns a function that when given a element creates a new list that is identical to the original list, but with the element at index updated to the new element passed in.</p>\n<p>So kinda like some sort of delayed replace function.</p>\n<p>I could be wrong. Really confused about the use case/goal here.</p>",
