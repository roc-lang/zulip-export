(Empty lists are treated as <code>listOfZst</code>, but when adding they should be normal lists.)<br>\nBut this lead me to a problem when appending a zst (empty record) to an empty list, so I tried to fix that. Then addint a zst to a listOfZst that was not empty did not work anymore. So I had a look at that and played around with the code and representation of empty records. <br>\nLong story short: Here is a draft PR that I don't know how to continue: <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/8645\">#8645</a><br>\nI think the first commit kind of makes sense, the rest I'm not sure. Maybe someone with more knowledge can use this as a starting point or let me know what to do.</p>",
