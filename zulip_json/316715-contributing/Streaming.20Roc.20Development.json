        "content": "<p>So this is just an idea in the back of my head. No idea if I will actually do it, but thought I would gauge interest.</p>\n<p>For those interested in Roc, specifically those potentially interesting in Roc compiler or platform development, would you potentially be interesting in watching streams or youtube videos of/about roc development? If so what would you be most interested in seeing? In reality, if I do this, it would probably be some mix of the below, but want to see general interest.</p>\n<p>I think there are number of possibilities for what I could specifically do depending on community interest. Here are my main ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Directly streaming Roc compiler development (maybe with some platform development). Would be focused on getting things done and hopefully explaining what I am doing. Would show what working on Roc really is like. Videos would also be uploaded to youtube for people to watch later if they want.</li>\n<li>Streaming more educationally focused videos/recaps. Instead of trying to stream the full live coding sessions would focus on recaps and teaching about the codebase. Would be more of a here is what I had to do to solve this problem in Roc. Would still be roc compiler development, but more of reviews. Maybe would do more Q&amp;As and presentations. Might actually shift away from streaming and more just towards recap videos on youtube.</li>\n<li>Streaming roc application development instead of compiler development. Maybe would take suggestions from community and try to push forward the possibility of building specific types of apps in Roc. Would definitely need to do some platform development to enable certain types of applications.</li>\n<li>Other. Please comment below.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any general comments, thoughts, suggestions, etc are all welcome.</p>",
