I've done so in <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/6594#issuecomment-2066209086\">this comment</a>, with the gist below:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Elm\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kr\">main </span><span class=\"nf\">=</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nv\">color</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">Blue</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nv\">when</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">color</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">is</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">#</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">crash</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">assuming</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">Red</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">is</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">valid</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"kt\">Red</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">-&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">Stdout</span><span class=\"nf\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">line</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"The color is red.\"</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I propose two possible solutions, with the second being better IMO. In short, we should tell users to provide more <code>when</code> arms (or a <code>_ -&gt;</code> arm) if we can't find enum variants during exhaustiveness checking. I'd like to pick this up if no one has any objections. I understand if the team would rather someone with more hands-on Roc compiler experience take the issue, no feelings hurt.</p>",

I first considered deleting it, but I don't know the team's position on saving history. Is it better to do what I did where I leave comments at the top and bottom saying to DISREGARD, or should I just edit/delete the comment if no one is quoting it or anything?</p>",

If my fixing the issue causes it to show both at once, that'll be lucky. It'd probably be better to have both errors shown yes</p>",
