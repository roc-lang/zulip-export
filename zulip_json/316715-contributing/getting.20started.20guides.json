I'm guessing that's not turned on for this site though. </p>\n<p>The local development server is loading index.html files when accessing a directory path, but it's not loading other .html files without the extension. I just tested the production website and Netlify is loading <a href=\"https://www.roc-lang.org/plans\">https://www.roc-lang.org/plans</a> or <a href=\"https://www.roc-lang.org/plans.html\">https://www.roc-lang.org/plans.html</a> equally well. </p>\n<p>Given that, unless we can turn on the Pretty URLs post processing Netlify configuration, I'll remove the .html extensions from the URLs and just deal with the fact that the local dev server won't resolve them. Unless you <em>really</em> want the <code>folder/index.md</code> structure for each sub-page, I think that will be cleaner. </p>\n<p>I do still think that the files that are in <code>install/index.md</code> and <code>install/getting_started.md</code> in my PR could be combined, but that can happen later.</p>",
