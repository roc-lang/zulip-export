Instead of having code in comments, which mixes concerns, have a more natural way to capture intent. Can we have the expects have doc comments themselves? Then they get displayed in the docs, and we could refrrence them somehow in the doc comments for the function? This would also make it much nicer to have one test that shows multiple concepts. To reference an expectation in doc comments maybe you can use <code># title</code> or some kind of convention. I have been thinking about a similar need for doc comments to have headings and this would solve both of those use cases. I think a great doc experience is looking more like a document with really contextual code examples and interactive experiences.</p>",

Namely, you created the <code>roc_fn</code> proc macro 9 months ago (<a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-webserver/commit/9e91ea20297b65bca0f0d1b760cac4cb591c5818#diff-b193e15805fb64cdd092341088971495587823519598f1b3e2bb36ab91a9be0a\">commit</a>) and it's used to wrap all FFI calls in the platform code, whereas <code>basic-cli</code> just sets up bare FFI calls. </p>\n<p>Though I can see the benefits of <code>roc_fn</code>, it seems better to align <code>basic-cli</code> and <code>basic-webserver</code> to make mutual platform task updates easier, and since <code>basic-cli</code> is the current flagship, I'm thinking we should remove <code>roc_fn</code> and basically copy over <code>basic-cli</code>'s impl to <code>basic-webserver</code>. Are you okay with that, or would you rather keep <code>roc_fn</code> at the cost of heterogeneity?</p>",
