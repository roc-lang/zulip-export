I'm working on a small toy project which I needed a Http POST for as one of the steps.</p>\n<p>I've set everything up following the docs and ended up with some encoded json and a request that looks more or less like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Http</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">defaultRequest</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">url</span>: <span class=\"s\">\"https://invoice-generator.com\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">method</span>: <span class=\"nc\">Post</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">headers</span>: <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">Http</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">header</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"Content-Type\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"application/json\"</span><span class=\"p\">],</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">body</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>but the API I was calling was giving me strange results, like I never sent any JSON. I debugged the problem a little bit,  and added some logging Rust side, and noticed that my request contains headers that go like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>headers: {&quot;content-type&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;content-type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;}\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>which lead me to find out that mimeType from <code>Http.defaultRequest</code> is always appended to the headers as content-type even if it's an empty string (default value there), which then seems to break the API call.</p>\n<p>An obvious solution for that was to get rid of <code>headers</code> in my Request and just set the request like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">Http</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">defaultRequest</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">url</span>: <span class=\"s\">\"https://invoice-generator.com\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">method</span>: <span class=\"nc\">Post</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">body</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"n\">mimeType</span>: <span class=\"s\">\"application/json\"</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>and this solves the problem, and the API call is being consumed correctly.</p>\n<p>Now, I think it'd be nice to have some checks in the Rust code that'd prevent this form happening, eg. if mimeType is \"\" then do not append it to headers at all, or if both headers and mimeType set the same content type, use only one etc. I'd be happy to experiment with that if you folks think it makes sense as an improvement. I have to admit I spent quite some time figuring out what's going on there so I assume other beginners could run into the same problem too <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
