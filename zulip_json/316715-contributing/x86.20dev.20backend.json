        "content": "<p>I just revamped all of the issues around the x86 dev backend and plan to be working on it more actively. I want to get it to a similar state as the dev wasm backend. It should be usable for any roc program that just uses common types (List, Str, Numbers, Closures, Unions, Structs). There is definitely a large amount of work to be done especially around builtins. That being said, there are fewer large new language constructs than I expected. So that is nice.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, the dev backend is not the easiest piece of software to contribute to. It is directly generating machine instructions in the form of a list of bytes. That being said, there are a lot of online tools and documentation. I, also, am willing to help/chat with/pair with anyone that wants to work on the dev backend. In general, I advise people to give it a shot if they are at all interested. It's a great way to learn.</p>\n<p>Probably the best place to start for new contributors in adding a Num builtin. The list of needed builtins can be found in <a href=\"https://github.com/rtfeldman/roc/issues/3513\">issue #3513</a>. If you want to work on a task, just convert the task into an issue and assign it to yourself. Feel free to throw up a WIP PR or just implement part of the builtin if supporting all types is larger than the scope you want to start with.</p>\n<p>For general information on the dev backend as a whole, look to the <a href=\"https://github.com/rtfeldman/roc/blob/trunk/crates/compiler/gen_dev/README.md\">readme</a>. For information on how to figure out x86 assembly, look at this <a href=\"https://github.com/rtfeldman/roc/issues/1932#issuecomment-964860520\">comment</a>. Also, here is <a href=\"https://github.com/rtfeldman/roc/pull/2034/files\">an example PR</a> that had to deal with assembly generation for a Num builtin.</p>\n<p>As a side note, some of the builtins are actually super easy to implement because we just wrap <a href=\"https://github.com/rtfeldman/roc/blob/trunk/crates/compiler/builtins/bitcode/src/main.zig\">zig builtins</a>. Adding these functions should be easy and a great way to contribute even if you have zero interesting in anything assembly.</p>\n<p>For a look into all of the issues that are open. There is now a github project for the <a href=\"https://github.com/rtfeldman/roc/projects/3\">X86 dev backend MVP</a>. If you have any interesting in contributing, please reach out.</p>",
