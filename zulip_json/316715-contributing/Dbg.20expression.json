I've <a href=\"https://github.com/mulias/roc/commits/expr-dbg/\">hacked together a working solution</a> by parsing <code>dbg</code> in expression position and then using the expr body for both the message and the continuation part of <code>LowLevelDbg</code>. This works in most cases, but there's a bug where nested debugs like <code>dbg (dbg (dbg x)</code> print to the terminal an exponential number of times. This is because the print side effect is doubled for each nested dbg, since we print once in the message code and again in the continuation.</p>\n<p>The simplest solution I can think of would be to desugar the expression <code>dbg x</code> into</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>(\n    v0 = x\n    dbg v0\n    v0\n)\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Which means <code>dbg (dbg x)</code> would be</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>(\n    v0 = (\n        v1 = x\n        dbg v1\n        v1\n    )\n    dbg v0\n    v0\n)\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>which will only print twice.</p>\n<p>Unfortunate <code>desugar_expr</code> doesn't have access to a <code>VarStore</code> so I can't generate new variables while desugaring. Is there a good reason for that? Should I try to pass the var store in during desugaring? Should I move some of the desugar code to canonicalization instead? Should I try a different solution?</p>",

Doing it this way means the parser can be more lenient, and then in canonicalization we can report if dbg was given too many or no args.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> When <code>crash</code> is called with too many or no args we continue compiling and fall-back to <code>crash \"hit a crash!\"</code>.
