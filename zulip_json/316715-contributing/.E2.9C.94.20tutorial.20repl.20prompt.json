The following snapshot is from <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20231122075243/roc-lang.org/tutorial\">Nov 22, 2023</a> and the prompt is not present there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/compare/6624abf93..57f7a79a5\">This</a> is the entire diff between the two dates. For instance, there appears to have occurred a migration from an older version of the website to a WIP version of the website, and the discrepancy might've occurred within that context, somewhere along the line.</p>\n<p>There are a few suspicious changes which might've caused the discrepancy. I'll try to find some time tomorrow to do a bit more debugging. I'll try to iteratively build the tutorial for each commit in the aforementioned range and pinpoint the exact commit where the discrepancy occurred this way.</p>\n<p>For reference, I think the code of the REPL prompt character (<code>»</code>) is <code>0xbb</code>, so it's possible that references to it might lead us to the culprit.</p>",

Alternatively, it <em>had been</em>, in fact, addressed but then it might've broken otherwise since then.</p>\n<p>I've also tested this behaviour with the aforementioned Developer Tools tweak, and it seems that when code is copied, the prompt doesn't get copied alongside. The output does nevertheless, but I believe that's expected behaviour.</p>\n<p>Any feedback regarding the direction in which we'd like to take this would be welcome! <span aria-label=\"pray\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f64f\" role=\"img\" title=\"pray\">:pray:</span></p>",
