The goal is to populate the repo with meaningful content so that it provides value to the community, and also tests Roc design assumptions.</p>\n<p>It would be really helpful if you can think of one or more ideas and drop them in a comment below. Bonus points if you can make a working example and share a gist too. <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span></p>\n<p>The Examples repository should provide working code that solves a specific need for a user. It should be as easy as navigating to a relevant example, copying it into a file, and now you have working code! </p>\n<p>The aim is to support a variety of needs such as; application templates, content for guides and tutorials, and helpful scripts etc.</p>\n<p>Other thoughts;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to describe <strong>what</strong> the example does, and <strong>why</strong> would you use it?</li>\n<li>It should be something that you would personally copy or share with someone</li>\n<li>The platform and any packages are URLs, not relative links, so it just worksâ„¢</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some examples of examples that I can think of to seed your creativity;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WHAT:</strong> Hello-World or similar minimal app. <strong>WHY:</strong> use it for teaching, so I can link to it from a tutorial or guide and share with people who are new to the language, or new to programming.</li>\n<li><strong>WHAT:</strong> Lists the files and folders in a directory. <strong>WHY:</strong> use it as a template for when I want to take a directory as an argument, or process multiple files such as parsing data.</li>\n<li><strong>WHAT:</strong> Run <code>roc check</code>, <code>roc test</code>, and then <code>roc build --bundle</code> on a specific Roc package. <strong>WHY:</strong> a script I would like to use in a CI action to bundle and share a package.</li>\n</ul>",
