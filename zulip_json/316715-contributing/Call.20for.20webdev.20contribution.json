As part of this I made a super ugly website: <a href=\"https://roc-lang.github.io/roc-compiler-fuzz/\">https://roc-lang.github.io/roc-compiler-fuzz/</a></p>\n<p>This is the much nicer looking inspiration website: <a href=\"https://devhub.tigerbeetle.com/\">https://devhub.tigerbeetle.com/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Fundamentally, the hope for this project is to make the website look nice and have pages basic filtering abilities based on url params (like : <a href=\"https://devhub.tigerbeetle.com/?fuzzer=canary&amp;commit=c2f152c77876d238d0605bd156c926e5ed3633bd\">https://devhub.tigerbeetle.com/?fuzzer=canary&amp;commit=c2f152c77876d238d0605bd156c926e5ed3633bd</a>)</p>\n<p>The goal is not bring in any heavy dependencies (though some sort of zig templating library would be fine if needed). I'm thinking it would mostly be a few small js scripts to make the site function (query time to print freshness, do filtering, etc) along with css for pretty colors.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>To work on the project simply fork: <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc-compiler-fuzz\">https://github.com/roc-lang/roc-compiler-fuzz</a><br>\nJust edit <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc-compiler-fuzz/blob/main/src/generate_website.zig\">src/generate_website.zig</a> to create whatever files you need in www. Feel free to add static assets and check them into the repo as well.</p>\n<p>Only dependency is zig 0.13.0. The site is built with <code>zig build generate-website</code></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comment here if you are interested.</p>",
