Cause `PlatformTask` really feels like it is defining a new `Task` type specific to the platform.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I think that even <code>PlatformTasks</code>, being plural, conveys the intended \"Task defined by the platform, not the std lib\" meaning without seeming like a builtin module. I'd also be okay with <code>Tasks</code> for the same reason. Does anyone else have any other suggestions. It's probably the best time to change things</p>",
