The primary purpose of this is to possibly create a static site to host the Roc examples. There are benefits to generating a static site for the examples; however the current implementation limits us to putting the code into the markdown file in a code example.</p>\n<p>I would like to have code in separate files e.g. <code>myExample.roc</code> and <code>myExample.rs</code> and then use a pattern for the platform to insert the contents of this file at the desired location when processing the file. This would make it possible to use the code's native tooling e.g. for tests or editing etc, and it is also more easily viewed when viewed in the repository online.</p>\n<p>The proposed idea is to take a code fence that looks like the following, and when the platform sees this pattern it replaces the code fence internals with the file contents, and then proceeds to syntax highlighting and produce html as before. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code># The `&#39;` characters are ticks\n&#39;&#39;&#39;roc\n&lt;&lt;&lt;myExample.roc&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&#39;&#39;&#39;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This functionality may not fit naturally with a Static Site generator, so we could also fork the platform and add it separately. </p>\n<p>Looking for feedback or concerns on this direction.</p>",

The case where your only code is <code>&lt;filename.ext&gt;</code> seems very rare to trigger accidentally. It's a really nice feature to have in the static site generator, mainly because it allows you to easily run CI on your code, so I'd be in favor of not putting that in a fork.</p>\n<p>A nice addition could be to specify line numbers as well <code>&lt;filename.ext:4-12&gt;</code>, this would allow you to show only the relevant parts of the file but have a big header and a bunch of tests in the real file.</p>",

Though I think the way we've implemented it also is pretty nice. I'm interested to hear peoples feedback on the examples repo PR. I think it is clear using the fenced code as it is a code block. The link is a good idea for when we want to do inline stuff. There might be a way we can use that to solve the problem of inline highlighting where there is no easy way to identify the language desired. Maybe we could do something like <code>[`my inline code here`](elm)</code> and that could be a way to specify non-default inline code highlighting.</p>",
