But a lot of issues are very difficult to reproduce. Especially in Roc's case where there is a platform dependency, and that platform has since changed, so a lot of problems are practically not reproducible anymore. The only person who is in the best position and perhaps would want to invest the time needed to see if it is solved is probably the issue's author. <br>\nI think it is the issue's originators responsibility to 'weed out' their issues. Although it is very common to see issue's lists of upcoming languages grow out of hand (I look for example at you Julia: 3800 issues / Go: 5000+ / Rust:  5000+), I think Roc should try not to follow in their footsteps. I know it is difficult because of platforms and high rate of development, but issue authors should make a deliberate effort to comb through their issues, and close the ones that are not relevant anymore. This will surely enhance Roc's professional outlook to the world, an out-of-hand growing issue list on the other hand signals too much instability/immatureness.</p>",
