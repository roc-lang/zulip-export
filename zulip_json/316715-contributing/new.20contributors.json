If you feel like reading through those and asking questions or making recommendations to help us update that could be helpful. </p>\n<p>Generally, Zulip is the best place for general discussion -- so feel free to make a thread here and ask for clarification if you don't see an existing discussion or can't find any using the search functionality in Zulip. </p>\n<p>The main focus right now if getting the new compiler ready for Advent of Code so we can try out the new syntax. Lot's of core work on the critical path that mostly Richard and Jared have been working on lately. </p>\n<p>If you haven't already, checkout the <a href=\"https://roc-lang.github.io/roc-playground/\">Roc Playground</a> -- I think that's a great way to learn more about the compiler stages and the intermediate representations in a human readable and interactive format. That's primarily only useful for contributors right now, but someday I'd love to upgrade that to the point where someone can use it to learn Roc and or experiment with different platforms. </p>\n<p>It always a bit of a challenge helping new contributors find meaningful work, when everyone has such different backgrounds and interest. If you feel like posting in introductions and tell us a bit about yourself, that could be helpful and is a great way to find others in the Roc community with similar interests. </p>\n<p>I'm usually experimenting with platform things, and love to hack things together to explore new ideas. I've been incrementally levelling up my compiler knowledge by picking up things that need doing. I've had some success just looking at the \"TODO\" comments in the compiler before, and then asking people about the next steps.</p>",
