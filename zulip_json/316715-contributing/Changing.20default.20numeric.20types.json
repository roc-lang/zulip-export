Where people do a math heavy benchmark with ints and are surprised it takes like 2x longer than other languages. Like for Dec, i think it won't be as much of an issue because the tradeoff is really clear why we might pick Dec by default. With I128, we really are just hitting performance without a clear reason and it would likely be unexpected by end users.</p>",
