I was going to have it show the full path to the file, such as <code>/home/cone/roc/interactive/echo.roc</code>, however since the path is unique per-machine it doesn't jive well with unit tests. So for now I'm just showing the file name, no path. I'm open to suggestions on how to mitigate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Somehow detect when it's a test and only show the file name, otherwise show the full path. I tried something like this using <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> but it didn't work.</li>\n<li>Somehow remove the working directory from the path, so it would show the relative path instead such as <code>roc/interactive/echo.roc</code>. I think this would be compatible with the unit tests. I don't know offhand a good way to get the working directory during the call to <code>Report.pretty</code></li>\n<li>Anything else?</li>\n</ul>",

Once there is a better notion of an application/package root we could use that as the relative base, but I think relative to pwd is a good idea</p>",
