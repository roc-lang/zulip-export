As always, anyone is welcome to join. </p>\n<p>I intend the scope for this discussion to be our compiler development plans (let me know if I'm getting distracted on a random tangent).</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"461444\">@Sam Mohr</span> has put a lot of work into the overall structure as a starting point, so I imagine we can go through that -- making a note for anything we want to talk more about or things that need further design work. </p>\n<p>I would like to avoid digging too deep into specific technical details and focus on the higher level abstractions like project structure and testing strategy etc, and our plans to collaborate. Specifically, I think we should talk more about what we think needs to happen and why, and then who is interested in doing what (in the short term). </p>\n<p>Having a meeting is a great way for someone like <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"461444\">@Sam Mohr</span> who has thought deeply about things, to give an explanation of our current thinking or concepts for the compiler pipeline, and any clarification helps give everyone context. </p>\n<p>If we want to go deep on a particular design, I think it would be better to have that kind of discussion in a Zulip thread where people can really get their thoughts out, or maybe schedule a followup conversation -- unless it's something that really affects everything.</p>\n<p>The process so far has been translating the minimal parts we need from the Rust implementation and following Ayaz's cor experiment and design. I expect there to be lots of places where we can improve things, particularly with the IR's -- so if you're interested in this kind of thing, about now (right before we start building things) is probably the best time to have the biggest impact on the design.</p>\n<p>The priority is to get an end to end compiler working with just the most basic features (i.e. functions and strings etc).</p>\n<p>So, I imagine the next steps will be filling in all the missing pieces to implement each of the stages, which will be much easier to collaborate on with a clear structure and interfaces.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you'd like to contribute or need any help. I'm no expert on compilers or anything, but happy to help point you in a direction (hopefully a good one).</p>",
