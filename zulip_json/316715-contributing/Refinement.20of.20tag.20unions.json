So in this case, the goal is for <code>error_unexpanded</code> to be <code>[Io Str]</code> and <code>error_expanded</code> to be <code>[Io Str, Net Str]</code>. References to <code>error</code> on the right side of the arrow would actually refer to <code>error_expanded</code>. My idea was that I would use <code>unify()</code> with <code>Mode::PRESENT</code>in order to ensure all the tags in the unexpanded variable were present in the expanded variable.</p>\n<p>So I tried that. But it turns out <code>Mode::PRESENT</code> isn't as magical as I naively assumed. It doesn't seem to continuously enforce a relationship between <code>error_unexpanded</code> and <code>error_expanded</code>; it just adds the tags in the <code>error_unexpanded</code> type to <code>error_expanded</code> at the point when <code>unify()</code> is called. (In this case, I think it just decided <code>error_unexpanded</code>and <code>error_expanded</code> were equal.)</p>\n<p>So all that's to say, my initial idea didn't work out, and I'm not really sure how to approach this.</p>",

That is, even though there is no principal type in that scenario, the three possible principal types are all incompatible. Moreover the inferred <code>[Io Str, Net Str, Timeout Str]</code>argument  is in a sense the most \"general\" type - in the sense that it admits more instances of polymorphic types than either <code>[Io Str]</code> or <code>[Io Str, Net Str]</code> does.

        "content": "<p>Thanks for bringing all this up. I think I've really internalized the issue now - which is that we have two possible kinds of branches in unification now, points of branches due to refinement control flow, and points of branches do to the order defs/uses of a variable are constrained in. If we fork in one, it might conflict with the other. With that in mind, some observations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This issue still means that we always retain principality (\"most general types\") relative to unification. It is true that you can now type a variable to be more general due to control flow, but inference would not infer types any more generally than it would be today. This may seem like a trivial point, but I'll elaborate on it later on.</li>\n<li>If we perform type refinement out-of-band of unification - that, solve e.g. a function definition via unification first, and then do a pass to refine and re-solve applicable variables - I believe that this issue disappears. The reason is that there are no additional constraints that are not already accounted for in the type if we go this route. There are some downsides, two are that (1) it may induce error during unification that refinement would admit, and (2) it is pretty complicated. In pathological cases it might require re-checking a whole function, but I suspect in practice it won't be costly at all. But this feels like a not-very-good option.</li>\n<li>A long time ago I had following idea: suppose we are given condition <code>cond</code> with a branch <code>pat -&gt; ..</code>. We say that <code>typeof(cond) = typeof(pat) = pat_unexpanded = []x</code>, and then create a <code>pat_expanded = [](x + y)</code>, where <code>x</code> is the extension variable used when <code>cond</code> is referenced, and <code>y</code> is used when <code>pat</code> is expanded. This has soundness issues and immediately breaks down, so it's not viable, but maybe there is some derivative design that works.</li>\n<li>The current idiomatic usage of the language means that you cannot eagerly type open tag unions in return positions, and as such, it is possible to return closed tag unions even when it doesn't appear so. For example, given the signature <code>{} -&gt; [A, B]</code>, this is parsed as <code>{} -&gt; [A, B]&lt;x&gt;</code> where <code>x</code> is unbound. The means a definition</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>foo : [A, B] -&gt; [A, B]\nfoo = \\x -&gt; x\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>will indeed be the identity and return <code>[A, B][]</code>, whereas the definition</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>foo : {} -&gt; [A, B]\nfoo = \\{} -&gt; A\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>returns <code>[A, B]*</code>. This was a deliberate decision for developer ergonomics reasons.</p>\n<p>With all that in mind, I think our options here are, if we cannot find another one-pass solving system, are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop the proposal in favor of keeping unrestricted principality</li>\n<li>Figure out a two-pass solving system (strongly opposed, not for perf reasons but for the others listed above)</li>\n<li>Keep the proposal, preserving principality relative to unification (I think this is completely unbroken, but let me know if I'm wrong), and expect that this case never occurs in practice. I am strongly in favor of this option, because (1) it is clear that refinement is the experience many developers prefer, and (2) it is already the case that you cannot explicitly type an open tag union (e.g. <code>[...]*</code>) in a positive position without getting a warning, because the extension is inferred by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let me know if I'm missing anything here.</p>",
