I have started to comment on these issues to give notice to people so they can close them.</p>\n<p>Would you guys be OK with giving me issue managing rights so I can just close them by myself? So far I have made sure that there aren't any open questions left before writing the comment to not close issues that are meant to stay open.</p>\n<p>I have opened my first (albeit small) PR on roc and I plan to contribute more, since I use it in one of my bigger projects!</p>",
