On top of that, making <code>check</code> cover all executables and tests, but then having smaller steps for faster checking. The most relevant probably being <code>check-test</code> which would likely be a solid default for most work. One thing that still annoys me with how zig/zls currently do checking is that if you have multiple check targets that include the same source, you get a ton of repeated error mesages. So for every executable, we get another copy of each error message. Theoretically the fix for this is to use more modules. That way the executables just import our \"main\" module and the \"main\" module runs check once on all the files it contains. I haven't tried factoring this way yet, but I want to make some of this nicer overall (though it would require a refactoring of imports).</p>\n<p>Have a draft PR for at least some starter work as I think of better factoring: <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/pull/7942\">https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/pull/7942</a></p>",
