I'm not really sure where to put this script. Should i clone <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli\">basic-cli</a>?</p>",

It may be a challenge to write it in roc, but if your interested we have a script for building the wip website using roc <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/www/wip_new_website/build.roc\">here</a>, if there are features you need to make it possible please let me know so I can add to basic-cli. Maybe raise them on zulip in the ideas thread.</p>",
