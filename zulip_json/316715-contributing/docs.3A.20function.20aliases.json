Was this an intended change or a regression when working on the new design? ( looks great btw! <span aria-label=\"heart eyes\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f60d\" role=\"img\" title=\"heart eyes\">:heart_eyes:</span> )</p>\n<p>I just noticed the footer with <code>Tip: Some names differ from other languages</code> but that did not grab my attention enough tbh. I just noticed that after starting to write this message.</p>\n<p>Suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Make it so the search bar handles \"not found\" results with a proper message + link to the \"some names differ\" page. Right now when searching for \"fold\" the search bar doesn't give me any feedback that the search happened and found no results.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I'd love this as an actual feature for enhanced search (find functions by aliases, tags, etc.), but I think this is way more complex and discussion-prone than just enhancing the UX of the search bar <span aria-label=\"grinning face with smiling eyes\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f601\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning face with smiling eyes\">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span> </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maybe we could do the alias thing just for the functions listed under <code>/different-names</code> ?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the suggestion sounds good I'd love to help out by working on it - if someone could just point me to the place in the codebase where I could make the change! <span aria-label=\"blush\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f60a\" role=\"img\" title=\"blush\">:blush:</span></p>",
