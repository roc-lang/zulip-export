I've been following Roc's development for about a year now and would like to start contributing, and I'm hoping to make arrangements with my school to let me use this semester to do just that! I'm aware of the Project Ideas document; I may be able to pick up one of those as to fill a whole semester, but I would also be happy to start picking up one issue at a time. My school would need a point of contact who is familiar with the project, as they can't meaningfully assess my progress from the outside looking in. Is there anyone I could get in touch with who might be able to fill this role? :)</p>",

I've been writing hobby projects in Rust in my spare time for a few years now, including currently a toy programming language of my own! I haven't contributed to an open source project before, but there's people at school who can help me get up to speed on that. I'm not yet sure what part of the compiler I'd like to work on! I was planning on picking up some of the \"Good first issues\" to get a feel for the codebase first. Code generation might be fun, but really I'd just be excited to work on a larger compiler project that's not my own.</p>",
