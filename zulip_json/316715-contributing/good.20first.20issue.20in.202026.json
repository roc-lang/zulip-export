I’m looking to start contributing to the project, but I’m a little lost.<br>\nI read the <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> and was looking for <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22\">\"good first issues\"</a>. The <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/6693\">\"Add # links for headings in generated Roc documentation\"</a> task caught my eye.</p>\n<p>I dived into the codebase and found that these docs are generated by a Rust crate <code>docs_cli</code> that is currently being rewritten in Zig, so I’m not sure if this issue is worth doing right now. Could someone suggest a good first issue that makes sense to work on in the middle of this rewrite?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>",
