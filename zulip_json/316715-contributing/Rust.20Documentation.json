I added a brief description for each library, however it is difficult for me to piece it all together as there isn't a lot of detail and there is <em>a lot</em> of code to parse. I would appreciate any assistance you can provide adding to this. Even if you only have time to comment here with a few bullet points; I can add to the PR. I think this will assist others to start navigating the codebase, and hopefully start contributing.</p>",
