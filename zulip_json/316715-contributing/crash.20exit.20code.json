I traced the crash call through parsing, canonicalization, and specialization; I believe it comes down to calling the platform <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/crates/compiler/gen_dev/src/lib.rs#L651-L681\">here</a>. I've tested this locally with basic-cli 0.10.0, and I can confirm crash exits with code 0. However, it looks to me like the <code>roc_panic</code> call should be landing in <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/blob/main/platform/src/lib.rs#L54-L71\">this codepath</a>, which we should be exiting with code 1. Is anyone able to help correct my mental model so I can understand this behavior?</p>",
