All of that positivity is because of all of you. However exciting and impressive Roc's progress is, it's because of the people who made that progress happen.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much, all of you, for making this language what it is. I really can't find the words to do justice to how grateful I feel that you've done what you have for Roc. I really, really appreciate it!</p>",
