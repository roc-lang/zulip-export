I'll file an issue, but in the meantime you can work around this by saying <code>[ZeroArgsGiven]_</code> and <code>[ReadFileErr Str]_</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I asked Ayaz and he mentioned that this should be straightforward to fix. I'm hoping we can discuss it here and someone might volunteer to fix it.</p>",
