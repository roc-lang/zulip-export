It adds two Examples to seed the repository and includes the basic structure such as the roc app to build the site and instructions etc. </p>\n<p>I have tried to capture future ideas/features in a single <a href=\"https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/examples/blob/main/ROADMAP.md\">ROADMAP.md</a> file for now. These should probably become Issues if we decide this is the right direction to go for this repository. Also the styles need a some attention, but they are good enough to get the basic intent across. </p>\n<p>I would really appreciate any feedback or comments.</p>",
