If possible, also run the output executable with <code>valgrind</code>.

Seamless slices are made to avoid unnecessary allocations and copying when getting subsets of strings and lists. Instead, we seamlessly convert them into slices behind the scenes. This can give more performance without anything changing in end user code.</p>\n<p>This comes to play in a few different locations. As a simple example of the performance gains. Splitting the text of Alice and Wonderland (repeated many times to give reasonable results) by spaces is approximately 50% faster. That said, the real gains come in any algorithm that might drop the first n elements of a List, or similarly create sublists. For example, parsers can benefit greatly from this. This function removes backslash newlines from a string in roc:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"CoffeeScript\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">removeBackslashNewlines</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">\\</span><span class=\"nx\">src</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">-&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nv\">helper</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">\\</span><span class=\"k\">in</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">out</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">-&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"k\">when</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">in</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">is</span>\n<span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">'\\\\'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">'\\r'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">'\\n'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">..]</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">-&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">                </span><span class=\"nx\">helper</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">List</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">drop</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">in</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">out</span>\n<span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">'\\\\'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">'\\n'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">..]</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">-&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">                </span><span class=\"nx\">helper</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">List</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">drop</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">in</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">out</span>\n<span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">x</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">..]</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">-&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">                </span><span class=\"nv\">nextOut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">List</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">append</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">out</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">x</span>\n<span class=\"w\">                </span><span class=\"nx\">helper</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">List</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">drop</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">in</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">nextOut</span>\n<span class=\"w\">            </span><span class=\"p\">[]</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">-&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">                </span><span class=\"nx\">out</span>\n\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nx\">helper</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">src</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">List</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">withCapacity</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">List</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">len</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">src</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Before, this function would have been mindbogglingly slow.

Please download a <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/releases/tag/nightly\">nightly release</a> from 2023-03-17 or later and run any string/list related code you have with it.
