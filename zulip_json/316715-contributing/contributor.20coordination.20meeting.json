Use the AES acceleration hardware to be about the same speed as PCG while still being attack resistant. Pretty cool idea as long as always running on hardware with AES acceleration (which is most modern hardware).</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02227\">paper on Randen</a>, they comment on PCG and xoroshiro. PCG they think is fine, just not attack resistant (though maybe modifications could at least make it ok). Xoroshiro is easily distinguishable from random. Not sure if that fully applies to xoshiro (the newest variant), but I think it still does from some other reading.</p>",
