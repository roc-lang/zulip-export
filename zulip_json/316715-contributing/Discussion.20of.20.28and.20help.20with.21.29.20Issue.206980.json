In particular, I have picked up <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/6980\">Issue 6980</a>. After having a quick look at the code I had a couple of questions that I'm hoping either may have already been answered somewhere and I don't know where or someone can help me with. I'll tag <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"361169\">@Anton</span> since they opened up the original issue.</p>\n<p>First up, <code>roc check</code> currently uses <code>check_file</code> from <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/crates/compiler/build/src/program.rs#L1176\">here</a> which in turn uses <code>load_and_typecheck</code> from <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/crates/compiler/load/src/lib.rs#L149\">here</a>. This means that we are expecting a Roc source file to be passed in right? That won't be the case if <code>roc check</code> can check code blocks in markdown files. One option would be to write out each code block to a tmp file and check those in the usual way but I was wondering if there was an equivalent to <code>load_and_typecheck</code> that would take a string or something? And would that be preferable?</p>\n<p>My second question is more on the user facing design. Currently, <code>roc check</code> gives output something like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>0 errors and 0 warnings found in 26 ms\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>in the simplest case. Given that we could have multiple code blocks (that we are checking separately) we should probably mark each block? For example, for the simple output we could have:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Block 0: 0 errors and 0 warnings found in 26 ms\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>etc. For the output with <code>--time</code> included we might need an easier to spot separator? Actually <span aria-label=\"thinking\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f914\" role=\"img\" title=\"thinking\">:thinking:</span> we might want that in all cases since even without <code>--time</code> the output of <code>roc check</code> can still be quite long if there are issues!</p>",

I would stick with <code>load_and_typecheck</code> and tmp files.</p>\n<p>For the separator, I would not worry about \"polish\" in this first PR. I would focus on landing the desired functionality but without resorting to hacky code of course.</p>",
