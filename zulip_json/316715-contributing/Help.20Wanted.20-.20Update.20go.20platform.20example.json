I do this in the kingfisher platform. The question is, what you want do demonstrate in the example. If you want to cross compile, then you have to use zig to help go crosscompile cgo. I was also able to do this in the kingfisher platform, but only with zig 0.11.0.  I am not sure, <a href=\"https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/7342#issuecomment-2216759920\">why it does not work with newer versions of zig</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want, I could change the readme to describe, how to build the GoPlatform example for the legacy linker for the native target (without zig).</p>",
