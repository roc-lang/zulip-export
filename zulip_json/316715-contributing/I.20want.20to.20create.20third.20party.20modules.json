Now I'm somewhat familiar with rust, can you please explain if I can create and publish modules or packages for roc? Just like we can do for nodejs using npm.</p>",

Also I want to build packages too but how can I make sure if I'm building something that is not already available? You may not have an issue with multiple packages for the same thing but if there's something already available then I can work on building a better one.</p>",
