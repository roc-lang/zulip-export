I made a gist <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/mulias/f0c16172fc699439da4f210b19002f97#file-main-roc\">https://gist.github.com/mulias/f0c16172fc699439da4f210b19002f97#file-main-roc</a></p>\n<p>One thing I wanted to test is this note from the tutorial</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is also the type that would have been inferred for table if no annotation had been written. Roc's compiler can tell from the destructuring syntax <code>title ? \"\"</code> that title is an optional field, and that it has the type <code>Str</code>. These default values can reference other expressions in the record destructure; if you wanted, you could write <code>{ height, width, title ? \"\", description ? Str.concat \"A table called \" title }</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I've found is that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>referencing other destructured values produces an <code>UNRECOGNIZED NAME</code>error, but works correctly if you run the code anyways.</li>\n<li>calling a function in a default value expression works fine when destructuring in the lambda params, but when destructuring later in the function body it blows up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the examples uses the <code>Array2D</code> module that I've been working on. I included the whole module, but most of it isn't needed. The important part is that the <code>walk</code> function tries to do this</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>WalkOptions : {\n    direction ? [Forward, Backwards],\n    orientation ? [Rows, Cols],\n    start ? Index,\n}\n\nwalk : Array2D a, state, WalkOptions, (state, a, Index -&gt; state) -&gt; state\nwalk = \\array, startState, options, fn -&gt;\n    { direction ? Forward, orientation ? Rows, start ? walkStart array direction } = options\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This causes the LLVM error example in <code>main.roc</code>. If you change it to</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>WalkOptions : {\n    direction ? [Forward, Backwards],\n    orientation ? [Rows, Cols],\n    start ? Index,\n}\n\nwalk : Array2D a, state, WalkOptions, (state, a, Index -&gt; state) -&gt; state\nwalk = \\array, startState, options, fn -&gt;\n    { direction ? Forward, orientation ? Rows, start ? {x: 0, y: 0}  } = options\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>then the example works fine.</p>\n<p>So, all that said, how challenging would it be to start digging in to some of these issues? Is it reasonable for me to start looking into the <code>UNRECOGNIZED NAME</code> error for cases where the code runs fine? Or is that still pretty ambitious?</p>",
