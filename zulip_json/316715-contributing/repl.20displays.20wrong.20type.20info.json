Specifically the <code>Num FloatingPoint a</code> was still being mapped to <code>F64</code>, while <code>Float a</code> is being mapped to <code>Float *</code>. Now that I understand that one is an alias for the other, I think we just need to update the other code path.</p>\n<p>I have branch on the way, just need to setup my commit signing stuff first.</p>",
