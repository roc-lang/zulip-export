I'm a beginner in roc contribution <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span> I'm trying to work in <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/5103\">#5103</a> adding the possibility to pass multiple roc files as arguments to the <code>test</code> subcommand.<br>\nDisclaimer: I do not have so much experience with Rust and also it's my first time contributing to a programming language internals. </p>\n<p>I figured out that we handle the test command <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/d232a843e44ee0f93ea63b5ad4ec7eae17067956/crates/cli/src/main.rs#L78\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>A simple solution would be to configure the <code>ROC_FILE</code> arg to use the <code>ArgAction::Append</code> to allow multiple values as input, and then iterate over them calling the <code>test</code> function for each one.</p>\n<p>This is the most basic (and maybe naive) approach, it could have some performance issues, I don't know exactly if we have a better way to handle this at Rust, I'm sure that we could do something to run the tests in parallel, but is this a design that we want to have by default? Should we run the files sequentially and maybe provide another flag to enable them to run in parallel?</p>\n<p>Any suggestions or guidelines that I should follow?</p>",
