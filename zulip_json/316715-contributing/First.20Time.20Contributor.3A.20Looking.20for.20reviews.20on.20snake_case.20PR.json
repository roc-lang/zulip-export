I don't have a TON of Rust experience, and obviously new to working on Roc, so I would like as many eyeballs as possible on the <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/pull/7233\">PR</a>.  Anyone that is familiar with the parsing and canonicalization phases of the compiler please take a look (Other Rustaceans feel free as well <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> ).</p>",
