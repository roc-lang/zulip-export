A smaller sentence like \"Values are immutable, but will be optimistically mutated if they are known to be unique, either at compile-time or run-time.

This actually works <em>really</em> well, but only on <code>.ttf</code> files. I've tried decompressing the <code>.woff2</code> files, but there must be something that gets lost in the original compression, cause it just won't work.<br>\nWould this be a good path to go down? I'm not sure how to guarantee that package is installed (I'm not used to Nix). I think it would work best if the original <code>.ttf</code> files were hosted in the assets repo and generate the compressed fonts off of them.<br>\nSome other thoughts I have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don't think <code>.woff</code> files are needed, <code>.woff2</code> has basically <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/woff2\">full support</a></li>\n<li>I'm using esbuild to minify the CSS which works real nicely, but...</li>\n<li>How is caching going to be handled for the CSS and fonts? The general way is to include a hash in the filename, which would require editing the generated HTML (although it's just a simple <code>sed</code> command, I'm sure). Actually I may have answered myself, it shouldn't be that hard</li>\n</ul>",

So it's basically a prominent ad that isn't relevant to me. I think this downside for this group of users will be disproportionately felt right now, because people who don't know what the language is and are on the homepage to learn about it will be higher today than in the future.</li>\n<li>If I already know what the language is about, and I'm just here to get an installer (perhaps not for the first time, e.g. I'm setting up Roc on a new machine) then having a big prominent INSTALL button is helpful so I don't need to find the smaller link in the nav bar, but again this has downsides for the previous group who want to learn more before deciding whether to install. If we're optimizing for return visitors, then it would make the most sense to have a big prominent DOCS button because that'll probably be the most common source of return visitors.</li>\n<li>If I've heard of Roc, so I don't really need to read the page to be convinced to try it, but I'm maybe right on the fence of trying it, and the extra convenience might push me over the edge one way or the other...this is the group I think will bounce later in the process regardless <span aria-label=\"big smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f604\" role=\"img\" title=\"big smile\">:big_smile:</span> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, I could see an argument for putting some additional get started and/or install links further down the page, e.g. after you finish reading a particular section of the homepage (like \"Use Cases\" maybe), if you're now sufficiently persuaded that you'd like to actually try the language, we can make it easier to take the next step so you don't need to scroll back up to the nav bar</p>",
