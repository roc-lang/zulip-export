Anyone have strong opinions on how this should work? I like the behavior described in the github issue; if someone types <code>##</code> without a space I would think they probably meant to write a doc comment, but auto-formatting _anything_ inside a comment might also feel a bit strange.  </p>\n<p>Some prior art: \"Gofmt removes leading and trailing blank lines in doc comments. If all lines in a doc comment begin with the same sequence of spaces and tabs, gofmt removes that prefix.\"</p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"361169\">@Anton</span></p>",
