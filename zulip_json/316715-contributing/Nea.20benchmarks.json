We plan on also implementing these for rust+nea, rust+tokio and nodejs. But having other languages, especially \"traditional\" backend languages like ruby or php in there would give us stronger results. </p>\n<p>I don't really know those languages, but contributions are very welcome. </p>\n<p>(also for the impatient I guess you can use nea + roc now)</p>",
