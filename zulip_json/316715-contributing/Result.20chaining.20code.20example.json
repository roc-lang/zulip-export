The code examples contain some error handling, but mostly at the <code>Task</code> level. For <code>Result</code>, the examples are a bit scattered, so I propose to add a new code example dedicated to <code>Result</code>s, and particularly chaining functions that return <code>Result</code>.</p>\n<p>I submitted <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/examples/pull/191\">PR #191,</a> please let me know what you think. Disclaimer: I'm really a beginner, so my code is likely to be flawed. Hopefully with your help it can become good enough, and useful to other newbies.</p>",
