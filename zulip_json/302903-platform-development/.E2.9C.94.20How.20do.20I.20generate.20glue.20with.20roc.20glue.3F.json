        "content": "<p>Yeah <code>glue</code> just changed very recently to a plugin model. It now accepts a <code>.roc</code> file, and unfortunately there isn't much documentation or examples anywhere yet that I have found. I think the focus has been on bringing it back up to parity with the previous implementation. I think <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/crates/glue/src/RustGlue.roc\">this</a> is the file you are looking for. If you figure out how to use it, can you please share how you did it? I've had a go at using the new version but haven't managed to use it yet. I thought it might be good to convert one of the examples like <code>static-site-gen</code> over to using it, but got stuck and haven't touched it again. I've just been focussed on Json and making more examples for now.</p>",

        "content": "<p>So <code>roc glue</code> now uses a roc plugin to decide what to generate (this enables support for multiple languages and any developer being able to write a plugin). An example plugin for rust (not 100% functional but has a solid amount of types) can be found in the repo as <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/crates/glue/src/RustGlue.roc\">crates/glue/src/RustGlue.roc</a>. This is the <code>GLUE_SPEC</code>. So if you want to generate rust code for a platform you would type <code>roc glue crates/glue/src/RustGlue.roc /path/to/output/directory /path/to/platform/main/to/gen</code>. The output is a directory now and in the rust case, it would generate a module with sub-modules for each architecture (re-exporting only the architecture currently used). As a concrete example, in the repo, you can run <code>roc glue crates/glue/src/RustGlue.roc /tmp/roc_type crates/glue/platform/main.roc</code> and then look at the output in <code>/tmp/roc_type</code>. Currently, I think there are only a rust glue and a typescript glue. Rust being much much farther along.</p>\n<p>Extra note: given the plan is to remove all hosted modules and effects, it does not generate anything for effects. That is why you have to use the workaround <a href=\"#narrow/stream/302903-Writing-a-platform/topic/How.20do.20I.20generate.20glue.20with.20roc.20glue.3F/near/350174614\">Agus mentioned above</a>. I should probably start converting platforms to the new format. I think we have all of the pieces to make that work now.</p>",
