So my next idea is to make a much smaller platform that just sends strings between platform and app and all the roc-json will happen in the app layer. </p>\n<p>Is this the general approach or am I just missing how I can use roc-json in the platfrom? The platforms I have found so far are not using any third party roc modules afik.</p>",
