It's definitely a pity that the definition of <code>roc_dealloc</code> forces this. I see this as a design mistake that we haven't fixed. I'm not aware of any strong reason to do it this way.<br>\nIf we added a <code>size</code> argument, we could make some compiler changes to pass it in from compiled Roc. It would also require changes to every platform that currently exists.</p>",

As far as I can tell this is an old decision and undoing it involves a lot of friction because every single platform would have to be redone. I know there are other changes planned to the platform API (changing Effects into a sort of state machine). If we are making other changes then we'd definitely want to batch them together so that there's only one upgrade to do.</p>",

The compiler is careful to ensure that Roc code supplies the right value. But nobody has written a platform yet that uses this argument. As far as I can tell, this is basically a bug in all our platforms that has been copied and pasted lots of times. But in practice maybe <code>malloc</code> already aligns to 16 bytes or something and we never ask for more alignment than that so everything is OK? That might be different in a custom allocator.</p>",
