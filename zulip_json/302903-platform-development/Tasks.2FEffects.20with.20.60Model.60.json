It is not possible for a read request to update the model. In the case of my Task example, the <code>updateModel</code>-Task would return an error on a GET-Request. <code>Task (Model, Response) _</code> would only be possible on a <code>handleWriteRequest</code>.</p>\n<p>Another part of the idea is, that the host knows, if the model has changed or not. For example on a POST request, on a unknown path, the server should return a <code>404</code> and will (probably) not change the model. The host can not know, if the model has not changed. So the host has to do all is \"model-save-stuff\".  So the type should be more like <code>Task ([NotChanged, Changed Model], Response) _</code>.  A Task would be nicer.</p>\n<p>But I think that beside of my use case there might be a need in other cases as well. It seems strange, that you have functions in your <code>platform/main.roc</code>, that you can not put into another file/module. Maybe there is another platform, that does more stuff on the roc side. Why should this platform has to  have to have all of its code in <code>platform/main.roc</code>. This is even more relevant, that it is currently not possible to export a function from <code>main.roc</code>.
