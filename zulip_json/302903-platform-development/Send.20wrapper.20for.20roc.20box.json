Being rather inexperienced in unsafe rust i would like some feed back on what I've written or if it would work at all... Thank you in advance to anyone taking of their time to decipher my code :)  Here is the link to the pastebin: <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/TS5AZapC\">https://pastebin.com/TS5AZapC</a> </p>\n<p>Edit: I recon something like this could be added to the standard library which could make the code neater as I tried some tricks to get the storage from the <code>RocBox</code> without having access to the private functions on it.</p>",
