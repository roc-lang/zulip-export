        "content": "<p>The big difference for portability is that musl libc is statically compiled into the app. So Libc becomes contained inside the binary (no system dependency to use it). With glibc, it is dynamically linked and depends on the version on the system (which can dramatically vary from Linux distro and version). This make glibc undependable if you want something portable.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I think cosmopolitan Libc is also fine, but not really needed. Generally speaking apps still have different configurations based on os internally. Unless you make all of those is agmostic as well, you still are stuck with a version of your app per os/arch. At that point, it is better to use what is more supported by an os than to use cosmopolitan. I'm also not sure of the production quality of cosmopolitan Libc.</p>",
