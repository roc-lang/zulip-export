Maybe this would be a better place to do that. This looks like a more mature game engine to target. I'm not confident I can build the zig-roc interface, but once we have that it should be pretty easy to add more capability. I could make a bare bones platform pretty quickly, with the build process etc just copying what I already have elsewhere.
