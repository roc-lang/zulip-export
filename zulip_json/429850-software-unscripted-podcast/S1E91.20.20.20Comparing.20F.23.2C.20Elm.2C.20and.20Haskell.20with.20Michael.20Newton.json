Listening to the various ways people plumb state through things made me wonder how one would idiomatically and cleanly implement threading common state that we see in our production code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>W3C Trace Context / Baggage — for annotating the current Trace ID onto logs</li>\n<li>Current RPC timeouts — used to cancel early if we've passed the deadline</li>\n<li>Database transactions (I don't think this one matters — one would typically achieve the same ends with entirely different patterns)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Presumably one would grab these from the platform and then pass them around explicitly? At work, our Java code loves hiding things in TLS (Thread-Local Storage), whereas our Go code uses the <code>context.Context</code> to pass things around (more, but not completely) explicitly.</p>\n<p>I'm a Go programmer by preference, but I can't help wishing there were some way to pass context around that was both explicit and didn't use up a function parameter.</p>\n<p>…and yes, hiding stuff in TLS in Java causes all the fun you might expect when passing control via <code>ThreadPool</code>/<code>ExecutorService</code>…</p>",
