It provides strategy combinators that compose very nicely and allow me to define what my inputs should look like and then runs thousands of random inputs and if it hits a failure, it shrinks the case until it finds the smallest example that still fails the test and reports that.</p>\n<p>When I hit new cases in CI I can just add them to the input definition as examples it should always try.</p>",
