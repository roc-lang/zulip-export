I do not intend it to be more featureful than what it already supports, as the main focus for Roc's editor support is the Roc editor. However, since that is still WIP, I hope this may be useful to anyone getting started with Roc who's looking for some help in their current editor along the way!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I only have access to a 12.6 aarch64 macOS machine, so that is the only prebuilt binary I can provide.I've left more instructions on building and using the language server in the release above, if you are interested in using this.</p>",
