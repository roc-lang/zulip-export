I also want to <a href=\"https://github.com/normanjaeckel/AdventOfCode/\">link</a> the repo of a friend, who also got all 50 stars of this years AoC with Roc.</p>\n<p>It was fun. Maybe even more then last year. The most frustrating moments are, when the compiler crashes. Maybe with less <a href=\"#narrow/channel/395097-compiler-development/topic/Panic.20.2F.20unwrap.20.2F.20expect\">panics</a> in the compiler, it will be even more fun next year.</p>\n<p>One this that was different then last year was my usage of crash. When I search for <code>crash</code> in my AoC-Repo from last year, I find it 66 times. This year, I did not use it at all. I just used <code>?</code> instead and returned an result. This is only a problem, when there are no <code>-Try</code>-version of a function. For example there is no <code>Dict.walkTry</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#narrow/channel/304641-ideas/topic/Handle.20Addion.20overflow.20crashes\">One big annoyance are overflow crashes</a>. I hope, there will be better traces next year.</p>\n<p>The last thing, that I hope will be better next year is calling single tests or ignoring tests.</p>\n<p>Roc is a awesome language and it is fun do to AoC with it.</p>",

I'm really glad that <code>?</code> has become a revealed preference even for advent of code, because that's how a lot of people will experience the language for the first time, and it's definitely much better for them to get in the habit of reaching for <code>?</code> than for <code>crash</code>! <span aria-label=\"big smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f604\" role=\"img\" title=\"big smile\">:big_smile:</span></p>",
