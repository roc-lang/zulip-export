It took some hours, but was fun. We analyzed the program. The solution is, that you have to handle the value for register A as a list of 3-bit numbers. Then you call the program for each of this 3-bit blocks from the end to the start. Try each of the 8 possible 3-bit values and check which of them gets the expected result.</p>\n</div></div>",
