Per <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"462053\">@JanCVanB</span> request, I've subscribed everyone who reacted to his post on #beginners to this channel.</p>\n<p>If you need a reminder, I'm also reposting his initial message that states the intent of this channel! :)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>New to Roc? Enjoy puzzles? Want to help Roc by simply writing apps and chatting about your experience? Sign up for Roctoberfest! </p>\n<p>The core Roc contributors are recruiting new Roc app developers to use Roc in October (starting this weekend) to solve a variety of coding puzzles, primarily the fun set from <a href=\"https://adventofcode.com/2021\">Advent of Code 2021</a>. This will stress test the Roc app dev experience, generate priority feedback/bugs/enhancements to implement in November, and prepare Roc as a language for an expected influx of new users in December. There is no min/max time commitment or participation expectation, we just want you to have fun.</p>\n<p>Please also invite any friends/peers in the next few days who you think would enjoy trying Roc for app dev, might provide insightful feedback for us, or just enjoy a coding challenge. <span aria-label=\"smiley\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f603\" role=\"img\" title=\"smiley\">:smiley:</span></p>",
