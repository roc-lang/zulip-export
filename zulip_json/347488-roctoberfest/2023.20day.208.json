It's coming along, but is still a little rough. I feel like I need to do some survey work on multidimensional array APIs, because it turns out the small amount of python I did years ago did not magically give me all the insight I needed.</li>\n<li>Working with opaque types is nice. When I first read the docs I didn't like that opaque types have a special syntax, but in practice it makes it feel more like a deliberate language feature, vs in languages like Elm/OCaml where it feels more like a trick you need to be taught.</li>\n<li>I ran into a compiler issue trying to set a default value for an optional record element. I'll try to make a simple example, but the short version is I wanted to do this</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>walk = \\array, startState, options, fn -&gt;\n    {\n        direction ? Forward,\n        orientation ? Rows,\n        start ? defaultStartIndex array direction\n    } = options\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>but I ran into a couple different compiler issues and couldn't get the value of <code>start</code> to rely conditionally on <code>direction</code>. I went with a different API for now.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not having any variable shadowing is super irritating. I wanted to have a public function called <code>shape</code> to get the dimensions of an <code>Array2D</code>. that meant I couldn't use <code>shape</code> as a variable in any other function. Doing the occasional gymnastics to not repeat variable names is not a deal breaker, but it's the most common papercut I encountered.</li>\n<li>The <code>UNRECOGNIZED NAME</code> error \"The <code>Foo</code> module does not expose anything by the name <code>bar</code>\" does not give a line number for the issue and can be a bit tedious to debug.</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<p>For the optional deconstruction, does it work if you do it all in the one line within the function? From memory I think there was a bug with the parser that meant it worked on one line but across multiple lines it didn't.  So <code>walk = \\array, startState, {direction? Forward,orientation? Rows,start? defaultStartIndex array direction}, fn -&gt; </code>?</p>\n<p>I'm not sure I have seen optional field destructuring as a statement, i.e. within the body of a function and not the arguments, that looks like a really useful feature. I'm not sure but maybe we should raise a thread in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"304641\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/304641-ideas\">#ideas</a> for it? Or maybe that is already the intended use for that, in which case it would be good to add an explanation to the Tutorial.</p>",
