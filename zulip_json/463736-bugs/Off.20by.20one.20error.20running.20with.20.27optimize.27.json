All functions within dict use the parts of it in a linear fashion. This means if you pass in a unique dict, it is correct to mutate in place. As such, the <code>List.set</code> calls within the dict module are set to be inplace. This is all correct assuming you always pass a unique dict into the APIs. We do not pass a unique dict into the apis. Before calling the dict function we run <code>inc `#UserApp.map`;</code>. This does not give us a unique dict. It explicitly gives us a dict with 2 references. I think we have a bug with owned functions arguments + inplace mutations. </p>\n<p>Specifically, owned != unique. Owned seems to mean that the function has it's own reference to the passed in data. So when morphic uses owned to mean unique, this leads to bugs.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure the correct way to go about fixing this, but it feels like a pretty fundmental mis-mapping between our stack and morphic. If I am correct, all uses of InPlace today are probably not trustable. Cause they might get passed something with a refcount &gt; 1 due to owned function args not meaning unique.</p>\n<p>I'm hoping that only something minor is off here (and I just don't understand how the pieces fit together), but definitely worried it is a bigger issue.</p>",
