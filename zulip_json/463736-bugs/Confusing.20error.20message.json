Turns out <code>as</code> must be a reserved word -- my error message was very confusing. It simple said \"indention incorrect\". I can try to reproduce if useful</p>",

I just tried the <code>as = </code> with the new compiler and it does not throw an error. <code>as = ...</code> is not something that would make sense with the keyword and I think the new compiler is smart enough to know that. So we're probably not going to fix this in the old compiler.</p>",
