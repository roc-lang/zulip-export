When using <code>try</code>, <code>roc check</code> passes but <code>roc build</code> crashes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-ray/compare/main...Giesch:roc-ray:early-return\">These are two minimal-ish repros in roc-ray examples.</a> They can be run with:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>just dev examples/early-return-question-mark.roc\njust dev examples/early-return-try.roc\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Edit: I made a <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/7224\">github issue</a></p>",
