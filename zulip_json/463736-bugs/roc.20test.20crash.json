It seems that the use case is valid (single file checking), but when we decide to add the msgs for the platform modules, we don't know if the file we are checking even needs them.  So the solutions I see are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thread a flag down to the handle_root_type function on whether or not to load the main path by default.  If we are checking a single file, this would be false.  We would then need a way to say \"Hey this file actually imports from the platform/packages in the main.roc, load it now\".  This seems smart, but would need to be generalized or would feel very rickity.</li>\n<li>Always force Can and TypeChecking on the platform and package modules.  Seems to be the lower effort thing and likely to \"just work\" in most cases, but would require us to do more work than we need to in many cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'd like to get some thoughts from some of the core team on this. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"361169\">@Anton</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"343810\">@Brendan Hansknecht</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"281383\">@Richard Feldman</span> (Sorry, I don't know all who's on the core team).</p>",
