Effectively it makes sure roc knows what code to run on the internal state by wrapping code and state in a closure. The type of the closure is just a zero-argument function returnin a combination of a value and another zero-argument function of the same type, regardless of the internal state.</p>\n<p>I'm not very confident that this will be efficient, though; so far the streams have been carefully constructed so that aggressive inlining and low-level optimisation should be able to collapse a number of stream operations into a single efficient one.

Roc needs to know the type statically in order to determine which function to call (by looking up what function the type provided to implement the ability). So it looks like closures is it.
