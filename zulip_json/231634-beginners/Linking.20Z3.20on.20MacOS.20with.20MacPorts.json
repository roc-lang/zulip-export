They are located in /opt/local/lib, where roc doesn't look. (I don't know anything about building/linking MacOS apps these daysâ€”perhaps the current equivalent to $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH can be broadened?)</p>\n<p>roc searches in some homebrew-related folders, /usr/lib (which isn't user-writeable), and /usr/local/lib (which is). Creating symlinks in /usr/local/lib to each .dylib file seems to resolve the issue.</p>",
