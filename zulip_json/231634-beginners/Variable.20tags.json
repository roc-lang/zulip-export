I'm wondering if the following is something I can represent in Roc's type system:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>swapTag : [a, b]x, a, b -&gt; [b]x\nswapTag = \\tag, match, replace -&gt; when tag is\n    match -&gt; replace\n    _ -&gt; tag\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Essentially, this would be a rather abstract function that expects a tag union which can contain a tag which should be replaced if present, but otherwise pass through the input tag unmodified. A variation on such a thing could be useful for rote error elimination in a Result (\"consider this particular error a non-error, and supply this Ok value if found\"), particularly in cases where <code>Result.onErr</code> is tedious. There are other cases beyond error handling in which I might want a concise capability to this effect.</p>",
