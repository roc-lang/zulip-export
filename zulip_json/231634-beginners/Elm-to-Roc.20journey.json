Example surprises:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pipeline operator passes the LHS result as the first argument (instead of last argument) to the RHS function</li>\n<li>No partial application / currying, you need to write an in-line function</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Has anyone else started their Roc journey already enlightened and/or ruined by Elm? Are there any resources to flatten that learning curve and help understand any differences in philosophy?</p>\n<p>I'd love to see (perhaps even write) a \"Differences between Roc and Elm\" guide, though maybe the audience would be too niche, and Roc is still too much of a moving target for that to be worth writing now?</p>\n<p>(I also respect that Roc is a different language with different creators, goals, and compile targets, so please don't interpret this as complaining!)</p>",
