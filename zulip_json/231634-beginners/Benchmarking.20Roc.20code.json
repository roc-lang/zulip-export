My objective is to have something that can give me real feedback for various ideas to speed up json decoding.</p>\n<p>What I have so far is relatively simple, but I would appreciate any feedback on ways to improve this. I have never really benchmarked anything before, and I played around with <code>hyperfine</code> and <code>time</code> commands but feel like just timing things from within Roc is probably also acceptable for now. It would be good to know if there are better ways to do this.</p>\n<p>Specifically, I'm looking for better ways to time the processing logic. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> </p>\n<p>My current idea is in <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/lukewilliamboswell/78de30c437c5f6e490dd89142e10191e\">this gist</a> and uses this <a href=\"https://github.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark/blob/master/data/twitter.json\">twitter.json</a> benchmark file.</p>",
