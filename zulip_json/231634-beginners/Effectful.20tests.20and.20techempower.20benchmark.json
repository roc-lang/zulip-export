I am sure it can go faster.</p>\n<p>Next, this initial version is using sqlite because that is what is built into basic-webserver. Because of that I did have to disable some of the database checks in the TFB test suite to allow the benchmark to run. Because of that the results are not formally verified by the benchmark framework. This is a limitation of the framework not supporting sqlite.
