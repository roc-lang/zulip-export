To make it a bit more interesting, I used this roc program: <a href=\"https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-things/blob/main/aoc-2022/12/main.roc\">https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-things/blob/main/aoc-2022/12/main.roc</a></p>\n<p>I just changed it, so main returns a string instead of a task, so it was compatible with the web-assembly-platform.</p>\n<p>Then I run the wasm-file with this go program: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/ostcar/17c7cc0257734128a4b29c060d09887f\">https://gist.github.com/ostcar/17c7cc0257734128a4b29c060d09887f</a></p>\n<p>This works, but it is much slower then a native build. When I run the code with the c-platform, i takes around one minute. With the go-wasm platform, it takes around three minutes.</p>\n<p>But I don't now how to go further.</p>\n<p>I would like to change the web-assembly-platform, so the main function has the signature \"Str -&gt; Str\". I have no idea how to do this.</p>\n<p>I am also very excited about this idea about wasm without a host: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/304902-show-and-tell/topic/wasm.20without.20a.20host\">https://roc.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/304902-show-and-tell/topic/wasm.20without.20a.20host</a></p>\n<p>Is it currently even possible to build a wasm file without zig?</p>",

The path is then compiled into some of the other crates in the compiler. (There's also a second file called <code>compiler-rt.o</code>.)<br>\nLater when we run the compiler with <code>--target=wasm32</code>, it will try to find those files to link them with the user's Roc code.<br>\nMy guess is that our nightly build does not copy <code>wasi-libc.a</code> and <code>compiler-rt.o</code> into the bundle.<br>\nSo basically right now Wasm targets won't work with nightly builds... unless you happen to have these files at the exact same directory paths as the machine where the nightly build was run!</p>",
