Note that if you plan to write more than a small demo platform, currently it is only convenient to do so in Rust. We still have several breaking changes planned for platforms but most changes will happen to the auto-generated glue code that connect e.g Rust and Roc. I expect that you won't have to do any major rewriting beyond that.</p>",
