Let's use this example: </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>a = {x: 1, y: 2}\nb = {a &amp; x: 3, y: 4}\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>1) <code>a</code> is a record but it is inside the curly brackets (feels/reads like <code>a</code> is field in <code>b</code>). <br>\n2) the strange feeling on the precedence of <code>&amp;</code> operator. Everything following <code>&amp;</code> is the update. But due to the comma, we might also read as: update <code>x</code> in <code>a</code> to 3 and set as value for field <code>a</code>, add another field <code>y</code> to <code>b</code> which is 4.</p>\n<p>IMHO, the update syntax would look better with <code>b = a &amp; {x: 3, y: 4}</code> to avoid those two confusions (maybe just me <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> )</p>",
