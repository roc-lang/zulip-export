I can see that this is something easier to explore/test than prematurely discussed.</p>\n<p>But just as a data point: I think Gleam followed similar paths (parens, inline type defs, ..) with the goal of being more approachable and it worked! But I actually use Gleam in production and I have to say - it is vastly different from Elm even though the footprint of both languages are similar. This is obviously my personal opinion, but I just don't feel the same \"joy\" as I do with Elm.</p>\n<p>This joy is, imo, what makes a group of super intelligent people to keep working on their tools for Elm to this day, even when the language clearly lost mainstream interest, so I think there is a value to be seen and appreciated that is not seen in many other languages.</p>",

The purity inference / binary algebraic effects with the ! Naming convention together with the for and var changes look to be really pragmatic choices that I’m looking forward to explore and the Algol/C brackets style is realistically a good choice for attracting more people to the language.  (As Reason found, syntax matters).  The lambda syntax change looks on first impression a bit confusing but i havent read anything about it yet (other than this thread). Is there anwhere i can read more about the static dispatch proposal/change as this is the first time I’ve seen anything on that too? Thanks</p>",
