But I don't know what the new crate should be named. Is that something which is usually discussed on Zulip first, or should I just comment on the issue? The contributing guidelines say I should talk to an existing contributor on Zulip before starting on an issue. Do I just ask like this, or is there some other stream/topic which is better suited? <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
