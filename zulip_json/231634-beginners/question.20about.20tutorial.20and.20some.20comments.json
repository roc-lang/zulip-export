Why isn't alias simply =</p>\n<p>In general my impression after reading the tutorial and FAQ is that the language is quite well thought out. It's very obvious that it wants to be beginner-friendly (e.g., the comment about else-if), but maybe that's a good thing. I understand the decision about Optional and HKP, but the one thing that I very disagree with is currying.<br>\nI've already shown functional programming to several of my colleagues, programmers and mathematicians, and I was able to explain currying to each of them in a few minutes. Even if they found it strange at first, they were able to appreciate the advantages. Why just don't support both styles? I know it's already decided, but it's sad, especially since I like the rest of the language.<br>\nBesides, my suggestion is to add some technical information about the language (e.g. about type system) in some intuitive place on the website. Most of these things are pushed into the \"fast\" section. This is particularly useful because the language does not yet have a Wikipedia page where one could see a summary table.</p>",

Calling a function with fewer arguments is always valid in curried functions; the error the user gets instead will unavoidably be some other sort of type mismatch, and it will be up to them to figure out that the real problem was that they forgot an argument.</li>\n<li>We experience a lot of benefits from minimizing the number of features and concepts in the language.</li>\n<li>Perhaps most importantly, once people gain some experience with Roc they never miss currying.

If you need it, because it makes the particular problem you're dealing with easier, you can manually curry the functions, the community isn't going to yell \"we don't do that here\". It's just not the default, since the assumption is that you need it way-way less than always. If you're interested, I suggest giving it a try.
