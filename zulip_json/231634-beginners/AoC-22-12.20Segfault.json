I've pushed the code <a href=\"https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-things/blob/main/aoc-2022/12/main.roc\">here for reference</a>.</p>\n<p>I've tried a few different combinations of things and the only thing that I have found that consitently causes it to occur is the <code>--optimize</code> flag. </p>\n<p>However, if I comment out the \"sampleInput\" for part1, I find it does build and runs perfectly ok with <code>--optimize</code>.  When I can do this with optimization on it runs reasonably quick (real    0m2.203s) versus without (real  0m32.181s). I'm not sure if optimised performance has any relevance to the segfault though. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>$ roc build --optimize  aoc-2022/12/main.roc\n0 errors and 0 warnings found in 2845 ms while successfully building:\n\n    aoc-2022/12/aoc\n$ ./aoc-2022/12/aoc\nSegmentation fault: 11\n$ roc build aoc-2022/12/main.roc\n0 errors and 0 warnings found in 1648 ms while successfully building:\n\n    aoc-2022/12/aoc\n$ ./aoc-2022/12/aoc\nPart 1 - Shortest steps is: 31\nPart 1 - Shortest steps is: 391\n</code></pre></div>",
