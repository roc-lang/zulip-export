I then read the page about <a href=\"https://www.roc-lang.org/platforms\">Platforms and Apps</a> which suggested that if I am  interested in building a platform then, in lieu of an official guide, I should come here and say \"hi\".</p>\n<p>So to provide a bit of context... I'm interested in building a platform which provides access to PyTorch and a few other data science-y Python modules. What I'm envisioning is a platform which exposes some of those modules' numerical capabilities (tensors, embeddings, etc.) as constructs in Roc, so that I can then build a Roc application using those building blocks. The motivation is to be able to implement the application-layer logic with all the goodness of immutability, algebraic data types, and so forth, which Roc provides (but not in Python). Taking another step back, I just think Roc looks really cool and inviting and want to play around with it, so I'm incorporating it into an ML project which I already had in mind.</p>\n<p>So having said all of that, does anyone have any suggestions for where to start? I'm wondering if there might be some already-existing Platform which embeds Python (or some other interpreter) which I could use as a starting point?</p>",
