When I quickly save a roc file and run <code>roc test</code> suddenly vscode says it cannot save the file because it's will be overwritten and contained unsaved changes and I believe a popover in the corner saying the roc plugin is stuck saving the file. After that CPU goes up by 10-20 % and doesn't go down. Every time I do these steps it keeps going up until my CPU is completely eaten and when I close vscode it is stuck saying it is waiting for something to finish. After I reopen the whole VSCode, CPU goes back to normal. </p>\n<p>I use roc in WSL in VSCode with a plugin \"Roc (Unofficial)<code>v1.2.0</code>\" by Ivan Demchenko.</p>\n<p>Is that a known issue? Is that the right plugin?</p>",
