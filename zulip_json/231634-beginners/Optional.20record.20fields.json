But having it means a more complicated AST, which means more situations that a rule might need to handle in order to be useful.</p>\n<p>Here's an example that's a bit contrived because in practice it wouldn't be an issue but maybe can give an idea of possible problems:<br>\nAt work I've created a rule that converts <code>Element.paddingEach { left = 4, right = 4, top = 0, bottom = 0 }</code> into <code>Element.xy 4 0</code>. With optional record fields, maybe elm-ui would be changed so that someone could write <code>Element.paddingEach { left = 4, right = 4 }</code>. Now this rule would need to look up data from the elm-ui package to know what the defaults are. Again, this is contrived because I'm pretty safe in just assuming the default is 0.</p>\n<p>More generally though, I don't know of any other language ecosystem that has something like elm-review*. I believe this is because Elm hits a sweet spot of lightweight syntax and pure functions that makes it easy for anyone to write their own rules or tools. For that reason I'm cautious about adding syntax features, it seems like it can quickly move a language out of the \"easy to create tools\" zone.</p>\n<p>*There are static analysis tools and linters for other languages created by one or more experts but I don't know of any tools in other languages that make it easy for just about anyone to quickly create a useful rule.</p>",
