I was hoping to put together a little demo of directly invoking Roc code from <code>elm-pages</code> using <a href=\"https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/dillonkearns/elm-pages/latest/BackendTask-Custom\">https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/dillonkearns/elm-pages/latest/BackendTask-Custom</a>. That feature allows you to directly call NodeJS code from elm-pages as a <code>BackendTask</code> and send/receive JSON data from an async function.</p>\n<p>Would be extra cool if I could use glue (create a glue spec, is that the right term for that?) to automatically create those bindings.</p>",
