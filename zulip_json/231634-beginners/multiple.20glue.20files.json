I'm thinking of building something like appium that generates xcuitests and espresso tests that call out to a zig platform and has actual test steps written in roc. It'd be awesome if I could just declare the roc tests and then glue generate both the relevant zig code but also the actual stub test suites. I could probably do something in the zig build file if needed, but glue seems more elegant. However from what I remember I have to specify an output file so I'm thinking I can only have one file atm? Am I barking up the wrong tree?</p>",
