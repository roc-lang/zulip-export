I've recently started playing with Roc and I've noticed that the only way to find packages that other people have made is by keeping track of posts here (e.g. in <code>show and tell</code>) or by looking stuff up on Google and hoping to find something.</p>\n<p>I was wonder, are there any plans to create some sort of package index for people to publish/register their packages? Or even something simpler like an \"awesome-roc\" github repo. I know Roc is still in \"heavy development\" but it seems to me there are already many useful packages, and is in good enough shape for people to make stuff with.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if this already exists then I apologize for asking :) Thanks!</p>",
