The program seems to be linking to <code>speech-dispatcher</code> dynamically, but I've never really worked with dynamic libraries in Rust, and am not sure what I'm doing wrong. The project is compiling and building, but when running, I am getting linking errors. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>",

I have found and installed two; <code>libspeechd-dev</code> and <code>speech-dispatcher</code>. I know <code>speech-dispatcher</code> is configured correctly, as I am able to run <code>spd-say \"Something\"</code> and it works. Therefore, I cannot conclude if the issue relies on my environment, or the way Rust is linking to those libraries.</p>",
