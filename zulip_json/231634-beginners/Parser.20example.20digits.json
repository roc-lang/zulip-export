However, it treats the parsed digits as their unicode codepoint (char 0 is 48 etc). However, because it tries to turn it into a decimal number, the result it wrong (e.g. the string '10' would be interpreted as <code>10 * 49 + 0 * 48</code> instead of <code>10 * 1 + 0 * 0</code>. I think the function should either return the correct decimal number (and maybe be renamed to <code>int</code>?), or it should return a list of digits, so the user can choose what to do with them.</p>\n<p>What do you think it should do? I'd be happy to do the fix</p>",
