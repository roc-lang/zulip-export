I was looking at the basic-cli platform and I noticed that there are some utility functions for sequentially awaiting Tasks in a List but not for executing them in parallel (similar to Promise.all in JavaScript).</p>\n<p>I supposed a large part of it is to do with how the Task is implemented by the platform and that Tasks can be used to achieve varying levels of concurrency based on how the platform actually executes the \"top level\" tasks. Am I on the right track with this line of thinking?</p>",
