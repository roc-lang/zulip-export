I just tried rockLovesC and the binary is only 32k. Very nice!</p>\n<p>I just picked up a copy of \"<a href=\"https://leanpub.com/fp-made-easier\">Functional Programming Made Easier</a>\" by Charles Scalfani, which teaches with PureScript. I appreciate the goals and direction Roc is taking, and I'm considering learning with Roc as a substitute. </p>\n<p>One suggestion for the project: switch to the c-platform from the basic-cli platform for the <a href=\"https://www.roc-lang.org/tutorial#building-an-application\">tutorial</a>. The huge binary size may turn some people off right away, as it almost did to me.</p>",
