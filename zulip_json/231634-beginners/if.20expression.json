So the function actually does something, it's just not observable from the language's perspective (changing global vars, writing to disk, ... ). There is no such fn is roc. Everything returns something, otherwise it would have no point of existing. Even doing effects (like writing to disk) is about returning a Task that will get executed by the platform. <br>\nYou rarely use the concept of nothing in Roc. For that, there is the empty record <code>{}</code>. You use that in like <code>Task.ok {}</code> for basic-cli as the return value of main. Buuut, you usually do that because you are using the <code>dbg</code> statement in your program, which is a side effect. Or you are measuring the performance of running a fure function. You wouldn't really use it in production.</p>\n<p>A payloadless tag still has a tag, so that would be a byte at least. When talking about nothin values, you usually think of the absence of something. At least when we are talking about expression based languages like Roc. For that, you would use an Option / Maybe type. Or just like how we do that in Roc: just use the Result type. <br>\nLook at List.get at <a href=\"http://roc-lang.org/builtins\">roc-lang.org/builtins</a>. The return value is either an Ok value or an Err OutOfBounds. The tag inside the Err tag is there to describe the error, but could have been empty as well. You would know that when you get back an Err, it is the absence of the value you were looking for, aka: a better version of Null.</p>",
