The glue generates the function stubs for each architecture inside the glue. And I just went ahead and implemented the function body. Like here: <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/blob/dee04a8ca735f2431e99631041c7105c3cd6d52e/src/src/lib.rs#L303-L313\">https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/blob/dee04a8ca735f2431e99631041c7105c3cd6d52e/src/src/lib.rs#L303-L313</a></p>\n<p>However, I am wondering where exactly the <code>Effect</code> type is implemented. In every platform so far it is defined as <code>hosted Effect</code>, which for me indicates it is implemented on the host side: <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/blob/dee04a8ca735f2431e99631041c7105c3cd6d52e/src/Effect.roc#L1\">https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/blob/dee04a8ca735f2431e99631041c7105c3cd6d52e/src/Effect.roc#L1</a></p>\n<p>But I could never find an Effect struct or the likes nor could I find its accompanying methods <code>apply</code>, <code>forever</code> etc. on any platform so far.</p>",
