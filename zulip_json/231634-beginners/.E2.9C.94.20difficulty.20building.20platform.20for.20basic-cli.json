I am trying to play with <code>basic-cli</code> example repo and for some reason cannot get past a user error that says the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>$ roc build.roc --linker=legacy\nLegacy linking failed: Failed to find any legacy linking files; I need one of these three paths to exist:\n    platform/macos-arm64.a\n    platform/macos-arm64.o\n    platform/libhost.a\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The error is confusing since I thought that invocation would invoke <code>cargo</code> down the line to actually build the platform/host for use by examples apps in <code>examples</code>. Is that not the case? Am I missing something vital here?</p>",
