I am trying to have a function which leverages <code>Result</code> but in the end I'm trying to \"masquerade\" a <code>DivByZero</code> with a more domain-oriented Tag (in this example: <code>NotEnoughItems</code>). I think this is a batter practice rather than just kicking a DivByZero to the consumer. However I am struggling a bit when trying to make <code>computationWhichWoudlntWorkIfListIsEmpty</code> into a .. \"lazy\" ? Or is it the case then in Roc, this value would only be evaluated if the <code>if</code> branch got to that point, and therefore I wouldn't need the <code>= \\_ -&gt;</code> syntax?</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"roc\"><pre><span></span><code>outerFunction : List (Num a) -&gt; Result (Num a) [NotEnoughItems, SomeOtherError]\nouterFunction = \\items -&gt;\n\n    computationWhichWoudlntWorkIfListIsEmpty = \\_ -&gt;  # ❓❓\n        # Here I can safely assume the list isn't empty. If the list were empty, this would result in an `Err DivByZero`\n        Err SomeOtherError\n\n    if List.len items &lt; 1 then\n        Err NotEnoughItems\n    else\n        computationWhichWoudlntWorkIfListIsEmpty () # ❓❓\n</code></pre></div>",
