I haven't written a single line yet, but I have (somewhat carefully) read &amp; understood all the examples. So at first glance, I am seeing a typed lisp (of sorts). I mean for starters, it is expression-based, nesting happens with parentheses (although the most outer/inner ones can be omitted), function invocation uses prefix-notation (even infix arithmetic expressions are de-sugared to prefix), bindings are immutable etc etc. So I am naturally wondering, why not admit your core-identity and/or heritage? What is this pathological fear of being labelled a lisp? In any case, the language itself looks super interesting - I can't wait to start playing with it. :)</p>",

Maybe you have written a pretty complex algorithm that gets run in one of the branches of your program and you are curios if you have done it correctly. In the other branch paths, your code is still the older version that produce a different type. You could just comment out the other branch bodies and insert a <code>crash \"not yet implemented\"</code> into each of them, but the current <code>roc run</code> command comes for the rescue. The compiler inserts a crash into the program whenever it encounters an error when you type<code>roc run</code>. I always imagine these crash messages being smting like \"I told you I would crash, but you just wanted to see it yourself.\"</p>",
