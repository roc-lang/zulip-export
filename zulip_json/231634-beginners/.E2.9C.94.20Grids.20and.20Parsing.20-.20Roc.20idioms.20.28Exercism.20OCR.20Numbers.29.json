I'm interested in seeing what techniques people would reach for to solve this? I don't believe it's complicated, but felt like I was forcing Roc in a direction that was unnatural. I can't apologise for being a beginner, but I'm sorry if the snippets below are not great!</p>\n<p>Grids have been a pain point for me in statically typed functional languages, and in this case the problem is compounded by having a subgrid of ASCII number representations within a grid of numbers described by the string, each to be parsed into the number they represent.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>      _  _     _  _  _  _  _  _  #\n    | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|| | # decimal numbers.\n    ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _||_| #\n                                 # fourth line is always blank\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I supposed I could represent each row as U8s, use <code>chunks_of</code> to get the groups of 3 (the width of each number), then transpose and chunk again by 4 (the height). My problem now was proving to the type system that that there were groups of 12 elements, which is where I'd usually reach for multiple clauses and list destructuring to declaratively handle each case.</p>\n<p>As (I don't believe?) Roc has list destructuring, I instead went the route of defining chunks3 and 4, to return 3/4-tuples the type system can reason with, (each requiring multiple list gets and result destructuring instead):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>chunk3 : List a -&gt; List (a, a, a)\nchunk3 = |l|\n    first = List.get(l, 0)\n    second = List.get(l, 1)\n    third = List.get(l, 2)\n    when (first, second, third) is\n        (Ok(a), Ok(b), Ok(c)) -&gt; List.prepend(chunk3(List.drop_first(l, 3)), (a, b, c))\n        _otherwise -&gt; []\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>with the final endpoint (after converting the nested tuples to a binary representation to make pattern matching less noisy) as such:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>    when s is\n        # gfedcba\n        0b0111111 -&gt; Ok(0)\n        0b0000110 -&gt; Ok(1)\n        # ...\n        _ -&gt; Err(InvalidPattern)\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This just <em>felt</em> bad, and I feel like I have either missed some standard library functions, or not adapted to alternative methods (or just written some very bad code!!).</p>\n<p>Transposing a nested list was also not papercut free (using the standard <code>map head</code> concatenated onto recursive <code>transpose tail</code>  approach) as it also required a helper function to prove that the list had a head available.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>transpose : List (List a) -&gt; List (List a)\ntranspose = |nested_list|\n    head_tail = map_head_tail(nested_list)\n    when head_tail is\n        Err(UnequalLength) -&gt; []\n        Ok((first, tails)) -&gt; List.concat([first], transpose(tails))\n\nmap_head_tail : List (List a) -&gt; Result (List a, List (List a)) [UnequalLength]\nmap_head_tail = |nested_list|\n    firsts = List.map(nested_list, List.first)\n    all_ok = List.all(firsts, |r| Result.is_ok(r))\n    if Bool.not(all_ok) then\n        Err(UnequalLength)\n    else\n        ok_firsts = List.keep_oks(firsts, |x| x)\n        tails = List.map(nested_list, |l| List.drop_first(l, 1))\n        Ok((ok_firsts, tails))\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I would really appreciate any pointers - Roc specific or general - for parsing and dealing with these kinds of structures idiomatically!</p>",
