This is what Elm does, and it makes pipeline-friendliness and curry-friendliness the same thing. However, it also means that either <code>|&gt; Str.concat \"!\"</code> would add the <code>\"!\" </code>to the front of the string, or else <code>Str.concat's</code> arguments would have to be flipped - meaning that <code>Str.concat \"Hello, World\" \"!\"</code> would evaluate to <code>\"!Hello, World\"</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And while I agree that <code>Str.concat \"Hello, World\" \"!\"</code> should evaluate to <code>\"Hello, World!\"</code>, i'm not entirely sure as to why<code>|&gt;</code>should not pass the last parameter. That would enable functions like map to keep the <code>map func vals</code> shape (which makes more sense in my opinion). Are there any downsides?</p>\n<p>Conversely,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One reason the |&gt; operator injects the value as the first argument is to make it work better with functions where argument order matters. For example, these two uses of List.append are equivalent:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>List.append [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;] &quot;d&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]\n    |&gt; List.append &quot;d&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>makes sense, but seems like an arbitrary choice when compared with</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>List.prepend &quot;a&quot; [ &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;]\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>where the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>[&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;]\n    |&gt; List.prepend &quot;a&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>wouldn't work as the list would be passed as the first parameter.</p>",
