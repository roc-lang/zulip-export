Though I'd recommend waiting a few weeks and starting with the new Roc Host ABI which we've implemented in the Zig compiler. This is significantly nicer to work with. If you want to see an example checkout the test platforms <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/test/str\">str test platform</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/test/int\">int test platform</a>. </p>\n<p>As soon as we have more functionality implemented, I'll be updating all my platform templates (Zig, Rust, Go, Swift, C etc) to help people get started building.</p>",
