It is especially useful for generating type signatures. Sometimes it gets the syntax or standard lib names wrong, but those are easy enough to correct.</p>\n<p>My only other experience with Copilot is in large Ruby on Rails applications which I have found it less helpful. This surprised me because Roc is such a new language and has less training data. Perhaps it’s because Roc is a typed language, or that Copilot is really good at AoC puzzles?</p>\n<p>What’s your experience with Copilot for Roc compared to other languages?</p>",
