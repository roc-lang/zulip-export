Your example only works if you unwrap the argument directly, right?<br>\nI'm not sure if my example was clear, but from reading the docs I thought this would also be possible.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>unwrappLater : Username -&gt; Str\nunwrappLater = \\username -&gt;\n    @Username username\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>But it does not work.
