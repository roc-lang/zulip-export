However if I have a Zig platform and am using roc cli from somewhere else then I am not sure how to provide this zig file. Where should the <code>lib</code> directory be located in this instance?</p>\n<p>I.e. I want to run <code>% roc build --target wasm32 examples/echo.roc</code> without having to manually copy and paste the <code>*.zig</code> builtins into the platform or app repository I am working in. </p>\n<p>This is the related comment in <em>crates/utils/command/src/lib.rs</em><br>\n// get the path of the lib folder<br>\n// runtime dependencies like zig files, Windows dylib builds, are put in the lib folder</p>",
