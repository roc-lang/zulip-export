But to do so, I would need to <em>read</em> the <code>[Ok Todo, BadRequest, NotFound]</code> type and convert it to some sort of <em>\"schema\"</em> that I would transform into a OpenApi specification or anything similar. </p>\n<p>My question is: Can I read roc types like values or maybe use a different approach to achieve the above behavior?</p>",
