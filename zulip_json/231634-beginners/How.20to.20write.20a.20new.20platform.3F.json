I haven't heard of any emacs plugins but perhaps you can re-use things from the (unofficial) <a href=\"https://github.com/benjamin-thomas/vscode-roc-lang-extension\">vscode highlighting plugin</a> or the <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/crates/highlight/src/lib.rs\">highlighting we use for the docs</a>. coffeescript syntax highlighting also works reasonably well.</p>",
