From the tutorial, it is not clear to me whether I have to create a <code>package</code> or an <code>interface</code>, or both, and how I can use it in my <code>app</code>. The tutorial links to some examples (Parse Package and Html Interface) on GitHub, but they seem far more complex than what I would like to achieve.</p>\n<p>In addition, in several attempts the compiler either got stuck or crashed with e.g. <code>thread 'main' panicked at 'There were still outstancing Arc references to module ids'</code>, and I'm unsure whether I've done something wrong, or if this is a compiler bug.</p>\n<p>Can someone please show a minimal example of creating one function (e.g. <code>addOne = \\x -&gt; x + 1</code>) in a separate file and using it in an <code>app</code> using platform <code>basic-cli</code>, that is supposed to work with <code>roc nightly pre-release, built from commit a187d14 on Mo 04 Dez 2023 09:08:55 UTC</code>?</p>",
