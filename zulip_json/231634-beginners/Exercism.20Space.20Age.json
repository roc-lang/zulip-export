When doing the Space Age exercise, I get the correct result with some rounding errors, but because the tests check for exact equality, it doesn't pass. I know the exercise uses Dec instead of floating points, so it should be exact in theory, but different methods of finding the solution will still give different results.</p>\n<p>Also the solution is rounded to two digits after the decimal point, but roc does not (yet) have a function to conveniently round to something other than integers. So I had to multiply by 100, round, and divide again which wasn't that nice of an experience</p>",
