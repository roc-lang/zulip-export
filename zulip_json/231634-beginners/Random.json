Very smooth and intuitive experience!) so it’s possible to implement an arbitrary prng). It can also generate a list of bytes which might be useful in combination with the decoding ability. It’s only standard distribution for now, but yeah, it can be configured.</p>\n<p>So, I’m planning to prepare a minimal poc. But maybe there are already developments on the same concept?

A feature I haven't seen but would love to is quick efficient \"branching\" of random generators. That is, if I'm writing a function that receives a random generator as an argument and calls three different functions that each need a random generator, I want to spawn a new random generator off the current one and pass eac function a separate generator. That way each gets its own repeatble sequence, and changes to one function can't affect the sequence the others receive.</p>\n<p>This does require randomness properties that are not usually tested for, but if it were a usable way of writing code I could imagine coming up with adequate generators.</p>",

But for me, it sounds like a special case of the high-level api for managing tasks, at the abstract level randomness is just a stream of bits. Also, sometimes it’s enough to just retrieve the seed from the platform to pass it then as an initialization for a pure prng</p>",

This is the common situation, for example with python's <code>random.random()</code> or C's <code>rand()</code>. In other languages one can even fudge the debugging situation by seeding the global random number generator with a deterministic value, but this is fraught with challenges - any reordering or skipping or additional work risks getting the global generator out of sync and scrambling your numbers. I think the approach roc could take here would be to suggest platforms provide a Task that returns true random numbers, a Task that seeds a global pseudo-random number generator (might as well be the platform's native one I guess), and a Task that returns values from the global generator. It does force the user to use Tasks every time they want randomness, but that's required by roc's purity.</p>",
