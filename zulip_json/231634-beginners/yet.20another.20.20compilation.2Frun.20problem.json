I haven't isolated  which line  causes problem yet. I don't have  much time for this today and isolating the problem, will take me quite  a while anyway. Maybe by chance  you have  a hunch?  Definitely compiler has a bug but sometimes usage of different construction  can prevent crash. Any help ?</p>",
