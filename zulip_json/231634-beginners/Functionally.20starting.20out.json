Not by much though. Looking at the implementation of walk, it is just a recursive fn as well. <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/crates/compiler/builtins/roc/List.roc#L495-L507\">Here it is</a><br>\n<strong>Getting into the nitty-gritty</strong>: Walk uses an unchanging list and an index to iterate the elements. Num.addWrap does not panic on owerflow so that check is skipped after the add operation, so it is cheaper than a regular add (and I'd imagine faster than a regular subtract with an underflow check...? we are at instruction level, so idk). You basically use the <code>.. as tail</code> as an index to keep track of the next list element. Instead of accepting a list and an index, you alway provide a list of which you get the first element. There must be an operation to create that new list. It is just a slice (no copying of the underlying list happens). A slice needs a pointer to the original list's bytes (incremented by an offset to start at the desired index, so there is a little bit of computation for you) and a length. The length will be the original list's length -1 (that is a checked subtraction (meaning it will panic instead of underflow) that the pattern match introduces). Pretty sure that's slower than the unchecked / wrapping addition. Not a big deal, but still something.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"343810\">@Brendan Hansknecht</span> Out of curiosity, couldn't this subtraction be Num.subWrap, since we know at compile time that for that branch, the list's length is always sufficently large?</p>\n<p>There is also the question of what happens to ref counting. When you create a sublist you increment the ref count of the input list. In the example I tried, it almost immediately decremented the refcount , before the next recursive call, but those are still operations. I have no idea if those instructions will get to the final binary or not, or how ref counting of slices work.</p>\n<p>Notice that these are related to the <code>.. as tail</code> approac, not to the recursion inherently. You can create a recursive fn that takes a list and an index, which you increment. That being said, at that point you should just use walk. It is a well know function, which makes it easier to understand than a custom recursive function with an index in it.</p>\n<p><em>This is definitely a micro-optimization, which you don't need. I just hope you found something interesting in it</em><br>\nI'll keep the Roc IR around in case you are interested, but I think this was already too much information. Cheers!</p>",

First of all, you need to be able to build the compiler from source. After that, what I did:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>changed a test case in crates/compiler/test_gen/src/gen_list.rs to a Roc code I wanted to examine. I could have done it with the mono tests, but this worked for me.</li>\n<li>set ROC_PRINT_IR_AFTER_RESET_REUSE to true (for example in .cargo/config.toml)</li>\n<li>run the command <code>cargo test --package test_gen -- &lt;name of your test case&gt; --nocapture</code> to run a test. With the <code>--nocapture</code> flag, cargo will let the tests print to stdout. </li>\n<li>Profit! Here will be the IR of your test-case. If I remember correctly, you also can just build the compiler from source with the ROC_PRINT_IR_AFTER_RESET_REUSE flag set to true, and you will have a roc compiler that will ALWAYS print out the IR when compiling your code, and you can use it as you would use the default roc cli.</li>\n</ul>",
