We could start with a very simple cli interface. </p>\n<p>Alternatively we've thrown the idea around of using a tui library for the roc cli... that's a bigger project and would need much more design work and discussion but also would be heaps of fun to work on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>is there some discussions on supporting <code>roc repl</code> in the new compiler? I think it can be a huge boon for compiler development</p>",
