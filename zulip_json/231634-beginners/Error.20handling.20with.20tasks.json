One thing I would like to add (please take no offense) is that in my humble opinion, we should not encourage anyone to handle errors in a way that makes an application return \"successfully\" with exit code 0 (<code>Stdout.line ...</code> will do just that). It is very problematic when scripts crash with exit code 0.</p>\n<p>It is like what I saw (decades ago) with Java tutorials full of examples <code>main</code> functions with <code>try ... catch (...) {}</code> just to get rid of a checked exception problem, when it was SO EASY to just add a <code>throws ...</code> to the function declaration and it wouldn't poison minds of those poor souls hoping for a better future with OOP: Java edition <span aria-label=\"cry\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f622\" role=\"img\" title=\"cry\">:cry:</span></p>",
