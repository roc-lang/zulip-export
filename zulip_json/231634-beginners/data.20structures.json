        "content": "<p>Hello! To warm myself up with the language, I decided to implement a red-black tree. I know it's already done in a benchmark but it's kind of my go-to thing with functional languages, and it's fun to do. Here's a paste: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jazullo/ad54284a8188caed47a785a1951fb59e\">https://gist.github.com/jazullo/ad54284a8188caed47a785a1951fb59e</a>. Beware though it's still untested, and exposing the delete function crashes the compiler. </p>\n<p>I was wondering if there was any syntax highlighting / editor support for Roc with common editors (e.g. VSCode). I realize it's early stages still but it would help a lot with making larger programs. </p>\n<p>Also, I was wondering if there were any plans towards adding any higher levels of abstractions. This could really be it's own topic but something along the lines of traits / ml functors / interfaces could go a long way towards creating more modular code. I want to keep going with the data structures and implement all of the common ones, but having a proper system for handling stuff like comparables or enumerables would make things a lot nicer and faster than trying to simulate these things with records. I understand the desire to keep things simple and Elm-like but I think for Roc to be general purpose it should at least have ad-hoc polymorphism at the level of what Python does. </p>\n<p>Thank you all for your time, help, and consideration.</p>",

In regards to a VSCode extension, I think weâ€™ve avoided it as to not encourage the use of other editors once the roc editor is more ready as a daily driver. Of course thatâ€™ll take some time, so someone probably will make one eventually and thatâ€™s ok.
