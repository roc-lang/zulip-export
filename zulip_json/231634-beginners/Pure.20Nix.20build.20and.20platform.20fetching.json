I'm trying to build the first example from the tutorial with Nix, but it is failing to download the platform. Nix prevents network access to keep the build reproducible. What is the recommended way around it? I tried to download the platform file and placed a relative path to it like that <code>packages { pf: \"./basic-cli-pltform.tar.br\" }</code> in my <code>main.roc</code>, but this gives me the following error:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>thread &#39;main&#39; panicked at &#39;There were still outstanding Arc references to module_ids&#39;, crates/compiler/load_internal/src/file.rs:1564:37\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\n</code></pre></div>",
