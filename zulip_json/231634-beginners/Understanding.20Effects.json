        "content": "<p>I’ve been playing with the Roc platforms and exploring examples a bit more. I have a few questions and would appreciate any assistance with some of my questions below. I think effects may be a new addition to Roc and just haven’t made their way into the docs yet. I’m probably just a bit early with these questions; but thought I’d share what I’ve discovered so far. I’m keen to help out with the docs if I can… still learning and trying to improve my understanding.</p>\n<p>What does it mean for a <code>.roc</code> file to be <code>hosted</code> as in CLI’s <code>Effect</code>? It looks like this module declares functions to make them available in Roc; the function definition is then implemented in the host. The keywords <code>generates</code> and <code>with</code> instruct the compiler to generate these functions in the host, and <code>after, map, always, forever, loop</code> tell the compiler to generate these functions for the Effect, which makes them available to other Roc modules. What is the difference between a Task and an Effect? They seem very similar, though it looks like all of the Tasks are implemented using Effects. Would it be possible to not use Tasks at all?</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>hosted Effect\n   exposes [\n       Effect,\n       after, map, always, forever, loop,\n       fileReadBytes # pub extern &quot;C&quot; fn roc_fx_fileReadBytes(roc_path: &amp;RocList&lt;u8&gt;) -&gt; RocResult&lt;RocList&lt;u8&gt;, ReadErr&gt;\n   ]\n   imports [InternalHttp.{ Request, Response }, InternalFile, InternalDir]\n   generates Effect with [after, map, always, forever, loop]\n\nfileReadBytes : List U8 -&gt; Effect (Result (List U8) InternalFile.ReadErr)\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>From <code>crates/compiler/parse/src/header.rs</code> the possible module types are;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>app</code> is the main Roc module which defines the app, see <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/TUTORIAL.md#app-module\">tutorial</a></li>\n<li><code>hosted</code> provides function types that are implemented in the host</li>\n<li><code>platform</code> is the main Roc module which defines the host</li>\n<li><code>interface</code> is a pure Roc module which defines types and functions, see <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/main/TUTORIAL.md#interface-module\">tutorial</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It looks like you can only provide a single symbol from a platform to the host, typically named <code>mainForHost</code>. This is why CLI takes <code>main</code> of type <code>InternalProgram</code>, converts it to an effect to provide for the host. Similarly in breakout <code>programForHost</code> is a record of functions which is provided for the host.</p>",

I really like the look of Effects. </p>\n<p>I think I am comfortable with passing a task to program. They feel like asynchronous callbacks and seem to be for initiating actions from app -&gt; host.  I recall a similar discussion on the logging thread about <code>Html.log</code> which seemed really useful functionality for a host to be able to provide. </p>\n<p>However, when I try and apply these ideas to the Action-State concept I'm having trouble making sense of it again. I'm not sure if this changes the <code>onPress</code> handler for the button? e.g.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Elm\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">button</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"nv\">label</span><span class=\"nf\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">text</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"+\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"nv\">onPress</span><span class=\"nf\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">\\</span><span class=\"nv\">prev</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">_</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">-&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">Action</span><span class=\"nf\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">update</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">prev</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">),</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Does the <code>onPress</code> here become an <code>Op</code> maybe something like <code>Update (\\prev, _ -&gt; prev - 1) (Result {} [] -&gt; Op)</code> chained into a <code>Render (Result {} [] -&gt; Op)</code>? How does the click event flow back in to update the model and the elements?</p>\n<p>When the host initially <code>render</code> the world, it can recurse down the tree, and when it comes across this button element it can save the closure. In the future when the host detects a click over the top of this button element it calls this closure and passes in the latest state for the button somehow, and then re-renders. I'm a bit confused about <code>Elem.translate</code> which seems to be a pure function in the Roc app, so the host can't see it, helps to do incremental re-renders. How can we render just the button and not the whole tree again? Or does this imply we build the whole tree, and then diff against the previous view tree?</p>\n<p>I feel like I've veered off course here, but I'm not sure where it's all gone wrong. I'm sure it will all be very clear when these new features drop and examples are updated.</p>\n<p>Effects seem a bit like Elm's Ports (Cmds and Subs), however I am guessing they are quite different. Ports were tags with a <em>Msg</em> while these include a tag with a <em>Model</em>. It would be great to have an ELI5 on if/how they are different at some point. </p>\n<p>I can see there are papers and video that explains the science behind effects system, so I am off to do some deeper research. <span aria-label=\"smiley\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f603\" role=\"img\" title=\"smiley\">:smiley:</span></p>",

        "content": "<p>Ok, I think I’m starting to understand. I’ve added corrections to my last post below, and expanded a bit.</p>\n<h2>Side-effects - Lazy Rendering</h2>\n<p>First if we look at <code>Elem.lazy</code> which has a side effect to cache views. It is defined as <code>lazy: state, (state -&gt; Elem state) -&gt; Elem state</code> and expands in the tree of elements sent to the host in render like <code>Lazy (Result (Cached state) [NotCached] -&gt; Cached state)</code>. Note that this is just a tag with a function closure. This function closes over the state that is passed in at the time lazy is called and saves it so that it can be compared. A <code>Lazy</code> tag isn’t a static element that can be rendered, the host needs to check the cache first. The host sees the tag in this element and it knows to check its cache, and then pass the saved value to the callback function. If there was something in the cache it will be an <code>Ok (Cached state)</code> value, and if not it will be a <code>Err NotCached</code> value. This is then passed into the callback function and the output will be a <code>Cached state</code>. The host can then store this value in its cache; and use it to render the rest of the elements in the sub-tree. The implementation of lazy checks the state that is saved in <code>Cached state</code> is <code>Bool.isEq</code> to the state that was passed into the lazy function at the time of render. </p>\n<h2>Without Side-Effects - Render Elements</h2>\n<p>The function <code>button { onPress : \\prev, _ -&gt; Action.update (prev + 1) } (Text \"+\")</code> expands to the following <code>Button { onPress : \\prev, _ -&gt; Update (prev + 1) } (Text “+”)</code> which is passed to the host in the tree of elements from render. The host displays a button and registers a click handler. When a press is detected over this element; the host passes in the value of the latest state, and the <code>PressEvent</code> into the <code>onPress</code> function. The result will be an <code>Update callback</code> action. Note that this is just a tag with a callback function. The host knows to pass the current state into this callback which gives an updated state, and then uses this to re-render the element. If this was a <code>Delegate callback</code> action instead then the host knows to use the updated state to re-render the parent element instead.</p>\n<h2>Side-effects - Using Tasks</h2>\n<p>Instead of using <code>Action.update</code> we can use <code>Action.run : state, Task (Action state) [] * -&gt; Action state</code> to queue tasks for the host on button press. For example consider the following task;</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Elm\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">myTask</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">\\</span><span class=\"nv\">prev</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">-&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"kr\">if</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">prev</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kr\">then</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"nv\">_</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">&lt;-</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">showModal</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"You click too much!\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">|&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">Task</span><span class=\"nf\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">await</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"kt\">Task</span><span class=\"nf\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">succeed</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">Action</span><span class=\"nf\">.</span><span class=\"kt\">Update</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">#</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">reset</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">the</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">state</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">to</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">zero</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"kr\">else</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n<span class=\"w\">        </span><span class=\"kt\">Task</span><span class=\"nf\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">succeed</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">Action</span><span class=\"nf\">.</span><span class=\"kt\">Update</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">prev</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n\n<span class=\"nv\">button</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">onPress</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">\\</span><span class=\"nv\">prev</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">_</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">-&gt;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">Action</span><span class=\"nf\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">run</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">prev</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">myTask</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">Text</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s\">\"+\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"></span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This expands into <code>Button {onPress: (Run callback)} (Text “+”)</code>, and closes the task into a callback for later. If the button is pressed the host knows to call the callback and pass in the current value of the state. In this case it checks if the value of the counter is above 10 and if so it shows a modal to let the user know and resets that value, otherwise it increments the state by one.</p>\n<h2>Things to investigate further</h2>\n<p>How does the host know which element to cache on lazy? Is there a reliable way to automatically assign <em>IDs</em> to <code>Elem state</code> values? or would some kind of path from parent, or maybe a hash be necessary?<br>\nHow does the host keep track of states and functions across <code>Elem.translate</code> boundaries?</p>",

There might be different design tradeoffs in native graphics compared to virtual DOM.<br>\nWith the virtual DOM I'm working on, I'm putting as much of it as possible in Roc, including the diff logic. In that design, the host doesn't need to know the structure of the Element tree. Of course it needs to <em>store</em> the tree, but that's just a matter of remembering a pointer and returning the same pointer to Roc next time. That way, Roc knows the structure but the host doesn't care about it.<br>\nThe host only needs to understand the output of the diff.</p>",
