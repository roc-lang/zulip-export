The method seems to work though, what am I missing?</p>\n<p><strong>Not dropping RocStr in Rust</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>RocStr</code> in <code>roc_std</code> implements the <code>Drop</code> trait, which frees the memory when the <code>RocStr</code> goes out of scope in Rust and if the ref count is 1. This leads to the use of <code>core::mem::forget</code> in host code.</p>\n<p>I'm trying out a version without <code>Drop</code>, which does nothing with ref count / memory - unless you want to store the value. In this case, there's <code>MyRocStr.incr_ref_count</code>. Here's the implementation:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/erwinkn/roc-platform-experiments/blob/main/platform/src/lib.rs#L84-L97\">https://github.com/erwinkn/roc-platform-experiments/blob/main/platform/src/lib.rs#L84-L97</a></p>\n<p>The host also stores all the strings printed by the Roc application until the end of the program and prints them again. If I don't increment the ref count, I see some garbage data, so the memory has been freed. If I increment the ref count, the string is kept alive, so the idea seems to be working.</p>\n<p>Are there problems with this approach? I'm still not sure I understand why <code>RocStr</code> in <code>roc_std</code> has a Drop implementation, so I may be missing something</p>",
