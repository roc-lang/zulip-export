The second one fails. <code>List.prepend</code> returns something like</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>[{ amount: 1, date: RD 1000 }, { amount: 18465.190817783261167616, date: RD 797499858 }]\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The third test succeeds. The differences between the second test and the third test are the two type annotations. <code>I32</code>instead of <code>Dec</code>. </p>\n<p>I tried with a nightly build and with a build that I compiled by myself. </p>\n<p>I tried to find some issue or pull request that seems to address this behavior. The only issue that looks somewhat relevant is <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/6139\">https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/6139</a> (Reference counting/oportunistic mutation bug (?)).</p>\n<p>I first encountered this behavior when working with <code>List.concat</code>. For this case, I had a look at the Zig implementation of <code>concat</code>. Everything looked fine, given my limited understanding. Unfortunately, I have no idea what to do next.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your help.</p>",
