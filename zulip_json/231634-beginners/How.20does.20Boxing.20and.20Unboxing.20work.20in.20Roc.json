The upside of using a Box is that sometimes you might have very large values that cost more to copy around the stack (because they must be copied on the stack to be passed between functions, for example) than it is to allocate them on the stack and only copy around the pointer to their memory address.</p>\n<p>The actual cost of allocation depends on the underlying allocator, it might actually be very cheap, but those are details that aren’t important for understanding Box.</p>",
