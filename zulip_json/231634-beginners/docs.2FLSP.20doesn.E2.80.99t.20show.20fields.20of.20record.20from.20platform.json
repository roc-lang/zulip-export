The documentation also doesn’t describe what a Request is: <a href=\"https://roc-lang.github.io/basic-webserver/Http/#Request\">https://roc-lang.github.io/basic-webserver/Http/#Request</a> The only way to find out the actual fields is to look at source code of the platform :(  Since Request is not opaque, maybe it makes sense to show its fields in LSP &amp; docs?</p>",
