        "content": "<p>I have a PR I've been working on but haven't touched much lately to cleanup glue gen for basic-cli so you can just run a script. At the moment it is a fair mess because it's usually the first platform to get features (written by hand) and then the tooling and infrastructure catches up. If you checkout basic-webserver that has a nicer glue setup. But note there are still some issues with glue which mean we have some workarounds to make it work. So it's definitely do-able rn, but I wouldn't suggest it's easy.</p>",
