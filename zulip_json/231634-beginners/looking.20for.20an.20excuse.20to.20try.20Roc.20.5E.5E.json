I'd like to try Roc at some point and was wondering if rewriting my elm test runner (<a href=\"https://github.com/mpizenberg/elm-test-rs\">https://github.com/mpizenberg/elm-test-rs</a>) in Roc could be a good project. Currently it's written in Rust and consists mainly of 2 things, (1) a CLI app (http, reading/writing files, calling other programs like the elm compiler, Node, redirecting outputs, etc.) and (2) a dependency solver (<a href=\"https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub\">https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub</a>) which is mainly pure computation delegating side effects to the caller. I wouldn't start now since I have to finish few things in pubgrub first, but could probably start before the end of year.</p>",
