        "content": "<p>I have been playing with the platform stuff for a week or so now and a couple questions have been nagging at me.</p>\n<p>In the Roc FAQ it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it's possible to write Roc code that can be used across multiple platforms. Applications can use platform-agnostic packages, as well as packages involving I/O, as long as their platform supports the I/O operations in question</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems problematic for very complex packages that most other languages hand off to some shared library or the OS. Some that come to mind are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>POSIX files and sockets</li>\n<li>YAML parsers</li>\n<li>SQLite</li>\n<li>GPU driver bindings / GUI frameworks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While it seems like no problem to create a platform that supports any one of these the issue would seem to arise in composition. With the ecosystem today if I want a sqlite database for my application I need to use basic-webserver. But what if I just need it in a cli context? At that point am I forking basic-cli to add it? Is every reasonably robust \"general purpose\" platform expected to embed sqlite? I don't see a world where sqlite or QT get re-implemented in roc. Maybe this isn't as big a problem as i think since the Rust package ecosystem acts as a pseudo package manager for platforms? Could some of the module param work I have seen happening provide \"feature flags\" for platforms?</p>\n<p>If you have read this far know that I am not trying to be antagonistic. I love the platform concept and understand that every design has its limitations. I am just trying to understand if I am missing something.</p>\n<p>The above quote implies that so long as there is a mechanism for it in the platform packages can be effectful. Has there been ideas around standardized effects across platforms? POSIX, Python's WSGI, and Java's ODBC come to mind.</p>",
