I've run into a few problems when trying to deploy it but managed to make it work. I decided to document my process in the case it is helpful for anyone else and/or anyone has any pointers that I could use to improve things:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/georgesboris/15fa2ab2ce6a5750b8c6bb3adc95f63a\">https://gist.github.com/georgesboris/15fa2ab2ce6a5750b8c6bb3adc95f63a</a></p>\n<p>(decided to put it into a gist so as not to clutter the chat here as it ended up being a bit long)</p>",
