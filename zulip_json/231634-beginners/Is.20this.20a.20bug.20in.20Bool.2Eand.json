Either way I think we could update the tutorial for others to be more explicit.  </p>\n<p>Quote from the wiki</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dennis Ritchie, creator of the C language, has said of the precedence in C (shared by programming languages that borrow those rules from C, for example, C++, Perl and PHP) that it would have been preferable to move the bitwise operators above the comparison operators.[26] Many programmers have become accustomed to this order, but more recent popular languages like Python and Ruby do have this order inversed. The relative precedence levels of operators found in many C-style languages are as follows...</p>\n</blockquote>",
