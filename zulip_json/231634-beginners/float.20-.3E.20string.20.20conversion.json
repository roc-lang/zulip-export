I know I've already talked a lot about scientific computing, but it sucks when you log a pile of numbers and none of the strings line up, or they just look totally different like when it jumps to exponential notation, or the negative numbers are shifted over by 1 due to the minus sign. It's worth looking at many other languages, because there's a lot of corner cases to consider.</p>",
