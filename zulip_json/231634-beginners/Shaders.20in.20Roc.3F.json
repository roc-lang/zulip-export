        "content": "<p>I'll just start by saying that I only have limited knowledge in this area. I have much more knowledge about tensor compilation and hardware, but that is not the same.</p>\n<p>The huge gain of directly representating vectors, matrices, and tensors is in easy extraction of parallelism. When optimizing at the matrix operation level, it is much much easy to know the goal, combine ops, reduce copying, and run in parallel. To do a matrix multiplication in roc would take recursive functions and rough to follow logic. The compiler would need to recognize that your recursive function was really a matrix multiply in order to extract the parallelism. That is much harder goal for the compiler and generally does not work well.</p>\n<p>Sure with roc, every function is pure. So if you want to compile a function that runs on each pixel, the functions could be run in parallel. But generally, you don't really want a function per pixel, you want one merged function that operates on all pixels. It might need to do masking and smart temporary creation in order to not waste tons of operations recomputing shared things between the per pixel functions. So in this case, roc may work, but likely still a lot of optimizer work to really build the desired output kernel.</p>\n<p>For GPU style control flow, I mean that GPUs have very limited control flow and tend to do a lot of extra work with masking as opposed to doing actual control flow. Mapping a when or if to a GPU wrong could totally ruin performance.</p>",
