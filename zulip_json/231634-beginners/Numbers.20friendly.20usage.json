So when the user sees a function that uses <code>Int</code> the compiler will end up constraining it to say <code>i64</code> if it detects that is the type that will end up as input or output. So overflows can definitely happen. I believe this is a lot faster than trying to detect and patch overflows on the fly by dynamically moving something to a bigger type, which is why this choice was made.</p>",
