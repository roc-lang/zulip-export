Cause I think as the current plan stands, <code>fromBytes</code> would take a list, but <code>toBytes</code> would generate a tuple. Need to decide the trade off between convenience and avoiding allocation. Might be a case where we also need functions to convert tuples to lists and back, but not fully sure.</p>",
