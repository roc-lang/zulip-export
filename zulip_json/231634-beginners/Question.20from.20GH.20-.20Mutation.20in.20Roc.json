I'm also curious to know practical it is for dealing with linear algebra so I was wondering if vectors/matrices are supported?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My second question concerns how Roc deals with mutation. As I understand it, the optimisation allowing for in-place mutation relies on the mutated variable not being referenced to later in the program. In programs dealing with larfe matrices, it'd be very convenient to ensure that mutation is always in place, so are there any features of the language to prevent a variable from being re-used? For example Rust has the notion of ownership.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Both List in roc and Vec in rust are dynamic so the comparison isn't relevant. Array allocates on stack if memory consumption is known at comptime, right? But Vec (or List) always allocates on heap. So if you want to have better performance (eliminating the reference resolution and potentially improving locality), in roc you have to use tuples. But you can't do <code>arr: [u32; 20]</code> like in rust. You have to generate code for tuples. Or roc can have syntax sugar for the same experience.</p>",
