This <em>seems</em> like just another monomorphizing/specialization case, though I don't know what subtle tradeoffs are involved.</p>\n<p>Since tag unions are a prominent concept, couldn't the compiler defer making assessments about runtime characteristics until the calling context is known? If the caller passes a <code>Parser Nat []</code>, then it's known that the final shape of the returned type is <code>Parser Nat [TooShort]</code>.

I think I've seen this happen a bit with Result handling (i.e. using <code>Err err -&gt; Err err</code> instead of <code>_ -&gt; result</code>).</p>\n<p>Why aren't/can't implicit conversions be permitted? I've seen a somewhat analogous case in at least one other language (interface itable subsetting in Go) where the caller context, or whole-of-program analysis, where the subset/intersecting entity (let's pretend it's <code>[B, C]</code> in this case) might be encoded in such a way as to be compatible with the superset entity or union of entities (let's pretend it's <code>[A, B, C]</code>, though similar would apply for <code>[B, C] -&gt; [A, B]</code>).</p>\n<p>In Go, behind the scenes (at least with the main toolchain), if you have an interface <code>{ Read(); Write(); Close() }</code> (simplified for brevity), it'll encode an itable like <code>0:Read|1:Write|2:Close</code> (essentially an array of signature definitions), and anywhere you use a <code>{ Read(); Write() }</code> or an <code>{ Write(); Close() }</code>, it'll just re-reference different slices into that same itable. Conversely, a <code>{ Read(); Close() }</code> would need a different itable entry, but it could be satisfied with a packing like <code>0:Close|1:Read|2:Write|3:Close</code>. All of this would be arranged during linking, similarly to how a linker might deduplicate identical strings (and substrings) into a packed portion of the readonly segment of the binary using an intermediate suffix tree.</p>\n<p>If the Roc compiler determines that the optimal encoding for <code>[B, C]</code> is a single bit, assigning <code>0</code> for <code>B</code> and <code>1</code> for <code>C</code>, but in practice it must be padded up to at least a byte if not a cpu word, then it's really got 256 or 2^32 or 2^64 possible tags, depending. In such cases, the compiler could determine that both input and output in <code>[B, C] -&gt; [A, B, C]</code> can share the same tag identifier assignments and memory layout without any loss in efficiency, and consistently assign the value of <code>1</code> to <code>B</code>. There would only be a potential efficiency loss, for example, when transitioning from a tag union consisting only of unparameterized (\"simple\") tags to one that has at least one parameterized tag, or growing from at most 256 simple tags to 257+ (or growing past other thresholds), or including a parameterized tag which requires more memory than the prior union of tags.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure any of those cases are worth forcing the programmer to micromanage <code>A -&gt; A</code> instead of being able to handle the new unique cases while using <code>x -&gt; x</code>as a fallback case.</p>",

Also, a global analysis means that tags with different names can collide, at which point you have to either say that <a href=\"https://schu.be/til-ocaml-polymorphic-variant-hash-collisions.html\">you can't have two tags that have the same representation</a>, or change the representation for all tags in the global program.
