This can be useful while processing the response of a website. The crawler could ask the host to parse and fetch elements according to css or xpath selectors. This can be done using a list and map, but the call would happen synchronous on the host side. It would receive every map call one after the other.</p>\n<p>There was discussion about Task.map2, but I've read the changelogs and couldn't find map2 nor Task in general. It seems that it has been removed. </p>\n<p>Would be great if someone with a little bit more knowledge than me could quickly chime in and answer this. At least I couldn't find any references to async/await.</p>",

One would be async/await for I/O-heavy operations like file reading, networking etc.. </p>\n<p>The other one would be parallel CPU intensive tasks, usually done on thread pools. In Rust, the first would be done using tokio, the second using rayon. </p>\n<p>This is already possible in roc right now, but one has to sacrifice ergonomics for it. I can simply introduce platform-provided methods that take a list of arguments. And return a list of results. One can introduce custom types to bundle the arguments, but it makes working with the result types and arguments cumbersome in a functional way...</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">fn</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">get_requests</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">urls</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">Vec</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nb\">String</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">bodies</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">Vec</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nb\">Vec</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"kt\">u8</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">headers</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">....</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"k\">fn</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">process_xpath</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">requests</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">Vec</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">Requests</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">xpaths</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">Vec</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nb\">String</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">....</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I think it would be nice to have the parallelism inside of roc itself instead of having to delegate it to the host.</p>",
