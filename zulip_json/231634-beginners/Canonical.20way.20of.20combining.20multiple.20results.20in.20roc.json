Or should I write a <a href=\"https://github.com/ni-ko-o-kin/advent-of-code-2022-roc/blob/e176fa9804d9ba598f8c4a55b2ca2adc258b0e83/Result.roc#L7-L17\">map2</a>? And why isn't there a map2 in the stdlib?</p>\n<p>Btw: I'm having a great time with roc so far! I'm very curious how roc will perform and feel on a large production code base in the future!</p>",
