I'm not sure but I suspect it may not be a problem with the new compiler (not ready to replace the old compiler yet). Can you try out <code>roc check temp.roc</code>, with the new <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/nightlies/releases/tag/nightly-2025-November-25-7b64ed9\">compiler release</a> and this file:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>app [main!] { pf: platform &quot;../basic-cli/main.roc&quot; }\n\nget_name : { name: Str, age: U64 } -&gt; Str\nget_name = |person| person.name\n\nmain! = |_| {}\n</code></pre></div>",
