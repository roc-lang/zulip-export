If you use Nix on a mac, you will use a Nix-maintained version of the Apple legacy linker which by default includes far more load commands and thus there is plenty of padding available for the surgical linker to re-use. If you are not using Nix, then you are using Apple's new linker (aka ld_prime) which aggressively compresses dynamic loader info, uses fixup chains, etc., which implies fewer load commands, which implies that the padding available between the end of the load commands and the start of the <code>__text</code> section is minimal.</p>",
