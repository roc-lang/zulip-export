It relies heavily on bitwise operators. When trying these out, I discovered that these operators are implemented in an unintuitive way. For example: <code>Num.shiftLeftBy x y</code> corresponds to python's (or c's, or any other language) <code>y &lt;&lt; x</code>. This argument swap is the same for all operators.<br>\nIs this intended, or is this a bug somewhere? There is a chance I am just plain wrong since I don't often work with these operators. However I don't think so.<br>\nIt would be nice if someone took a look at this!</p>",
