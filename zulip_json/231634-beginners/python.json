You can also do it <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/examples/python-interop\">without PyO3</a>. Although (for both approaches) for non-trivial use, I would recommend a good dose of general experience with the low level stuff like you see <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/examples/python-interop\">here</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can be used the rust's grpc server lib on roc?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The async stuff may be tricky, can you talk some more about how you want to combine the two?</p>",
