Note that since you copied the binary, you'll need to copy it again if you install a new version of Roc in the future. If you don't, you'll have an outdated LSP running which will probably give you some wonky behaviour!</p>\n<p>I'd humbly suggest that you install Roc using <code>rocup</code> now that you have a <code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory. That way it'll always work for you and it'll be a good experience!</p>\n<p>If you don't want to use <code>rocup</code>, you could:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove the copy of Roc LSP (<code>rm /usr/local/bin/roc_language_server</code>).</li>\n<li>Check where it's located by default  (<code>which roc_language_server</code>). This'll depend on how you installed Roc.</li>\n<li>Add that directory to your <code>PATH</code> (<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/nex3/c395b2f8fd4b02068be37c961301caa7\">https://gist.github.com/nex3/c395b2f8fd4b02068be37c961301caa7</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It'll now always work and be up-to-date when you install new versions of Roc!</p>\n<p>PS. If you don't want to edit the <code>PATH</code> you could alternatively symlink the LSP binary to a directory that's already in your <code>PATH</code>.</p>\n<p>Happy Roc-ing! Let me know if I can help with anything!</p>",
