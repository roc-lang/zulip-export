        "content": "<p>Hi all, I'm a total beginner to Roc, but I know some other functional programming languages. I was reading the FAQ and I got really curious about the <em>cultural implications of monads</em>.<br>\nFrom <a href=\"https://www.roc-lang.org/faq.html\">https://www.roc-lang.org/faq.html</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Considering that these are the only three options, an early decision in Roc's design—not only on a technical level, but on a cultural level as well—was to make it clear that the plan is for Roc never to support HKP. The hope is that this clarity can save a lot of community members' time that would otherwise be spent on advocacy or arguing between the two sides of the divide. Again, it's completely reasonable for anyone to have a different preference, but given that languages can only choose one of these options, it seems clear that the right choice for Roc is for it to never have higher-kinded polymorphism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously I am on the HKP of the divide that allows defining Monads inside the language. I am so deep in my bubble that I cannot understand why it makes a difference. I thought the divide was between functional and imperative paradigms, not between monads and antimonads. Could someone explain where this dismay for a language feature comes from, so I could better understand both sides of the coin? Thanks and best wishes.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I think there are several points, but for me it is keeping the language small. Roc is a descendant of Elm, which also does not have HKP. What I love about both Roc and Elm is that it is so small that I can basically keep the whole language in my head. Also it's easier for beginners. I tried to learn Haskell, but that monad stuff was too strange to me. I just did not understand the purpose of it. After learning Elm, it was quite easy to see the common pattern, that is called a monad. Not a big difference in practice, if I use a special bind operator or a specific function for the type, that can also have a nice name.</p>",

I had no functional background but was able to learn it easily. Basically if you have seen recursion and pattern matching, there isn't much extra learning to do with Roc. I spent like a whole day trying to understand Monads (because I got the impression that I need to do that before I can learn Haskell, or any functional programming). Didn't succeed, so didn't learn Haskell.<br>\nSo I see the divide as \"Mondas scare off non functional programmers, but make hardcore (to me that's the right word) functional programmers happy\". Since the goal of Roc is to be widely adopted, it needs to appeal to non functional programmers.</p>",

I would explain it as the interface of doing stuff <em>in a context</em>, be it async context, context where an error can be thrown or the context of the standard input/output. Each statement is not only doing what it says it does, it also has an additional effect in the background context.</p>",

I admit, it may not be the best mentality, but at this stage of my fp journey, I don't want to learn them. It is hard enaugh to shift my programming thinking to expressions with immutability where there were statements before. I'm sure it would be awesome to create my own functions that would work withe the proposed <code>!</code> operator (if I understand correctly that would require HKP) instead of only Task.await (or was it attempt?) and Result.try having access to it, but I am just not there yet.</p>",
