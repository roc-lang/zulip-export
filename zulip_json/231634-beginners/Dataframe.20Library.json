Naturally, i think dynamic languages are well suited in that they often can flexibly do things with data of different types. That said, often they do the wrong thing or crash due to wrong types. A dynamic language that properly had hooks to help you deal with wrong types probably would be very well suited.</p>\n<p>That said, with a simple tag union type and doing the work to wrap everything, a typed language can do quite well. I think it has some wins and some losses. Obvious win is that it forces you to deal with all possible types. Obvious loss, dealing with all types is a pain and often a big loss in terms of perf. A jited dynamic language can optimize for the single expected type and essential recover via exceptions if it hits an unexpected type. That can be a huge perf gain if your data through certain functions is mostly regular.</p>\n<p>I feel like true messy data frames are case where you both do and don't want types.

        "content": "<p>I've also thought about what a dataframes library would look like in Roc. I don't think there's been a dataframes library that takes advantage of static types yet, but I think there's reasons why it hasn't been attempted/suceeded.</p>\n<div class=\"spoiler-block\"><div class=\"spoiler-header\">\n<p>I wrote a long and rambling thing about dataframe libraries here, read at your own peril</p>\n</div><div class=\"spoiler-content\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n<p>Some background, I was a data scientist and am now a data engineer, I've used R/dplyr for about 5 years, Python/Pandas for 2 years, and Julia/DataFrames.jl for 4, with most of those years overlapping. I switched to data engineering partly because I was slightly disillusioned with the field of data science, so keep that in mind if you carry on reading. If you're interested in why, I read a blogpost a while ago that echoed my thoughts closely. I can't find it now, but it was similar to <a href=\"https://ryxcommar.com/2022/11/27/goodbye-data-science/\">this one</a>.</p>\n<p>The typical users of a dataframe library are data analysts or data scientists. The most common workflow I've seen is opening a Jupyter notebook, reading data from a CSV or JSON file and then executing commands one by one and looking at the output to explore the data. This kind of exploration requires an intuitive and powerful UX. Your ability to quickly clean and then transform the data is the highest priority, the cleanness of your code isn't that important because it will only be run once to get the summary table or plots. The kinds of bugs that static types can catch are normally not relevant here because of the very quick feedback loop, you might want to clean up a column by transforming it somehow, and if you misremember the type of the column you'll see the mistake almost instantly in the output of that cell. The other kinds of bugs that static types can mitigate are correctness bugs, but to be honest, as a data scientist there was never much pressure for the analyses to be correct, it's a lot of gut and vibes, and at the end of the day as long as the output seems plausible nobody ever checks it for correctness.</p>\n<p>The other users of dataframe libraries are the engineers who are tasked with taking an analyst's jupyter notebook and productionising it into a dashboard or a generated report. These kinds of users care more about clean, correct and fast code, so might be more open to using Roc. The thing is, these kinds of tasks are mostly done in data warehouses nowadays like Snowflake or Clickhouse where you can only use SQL. SQL is a great tool for writing these data pipelines, the syntax sucks, but the declarative nature means it's great for transforming data.</p>\n<p>I think writing a dataframes library in Roc would eat up a lot of time, all of the existing solutions have had a lot of effort put into making them fast, see <a href=\"https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/\">these benchmarks</a>. Maybe one takeaway from those benchmarks is how fast Julia's DataFrames.jl is. Most other dataframe libraries are written in languages without a GC (polars in Rust, Clickhouse in C++, data.table in C, pandas in C/C++), but Julia is GC'd and uses LLVM like Roc, so in theory performance of a Roc dataframe library could be very good.</p>\n<p>In terms of getting inspiration, I can't stand the pandas API. It's so incredibly inconsistent and unergonomic, I have to look up the syntax for every operation each time I use it. Dplyr is the best in terms of ergonomics 99&amp; of the time, but its heavy reliance on metaprogramming means in 1% of cases it blows up with an extremely unhelpful error message. Julia's DataFrames.jl feels closer to the Roc philosophy by being much more explicit than dplyr and having a small, curated list of functions compared with dplyr's massive list of features. The closest to what I imagine a Roc dataframe library being is probably Rust's polars, which is what Elixir's Explorer uses under the hood. I've not used it in Rust, but in Python the syntax feels very verbose and quite strange, it barely uses any native Python features and is basically its own DSL. I imagine if I learnt that DSL it would be nice to use, and it's rediculously fast (see the benchmarks above).</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>Having said all that, I would still like to see what a dataframes library in Roc would look like. The key thing I'd like is to take advantage of Roc's type checker to typecheck the types of the columns, I believe this is something that not even polars does, the only example I know of is Julia's <code>TypedTables.jl</code>, but Julia can't be statically type checked, so it doesn't take advantage of this fact.</p>\n<p>I thought about trying to rewrite one of my analyses in Roc using a list of records as a kind of basic dataframe to see how far I could get, but the first step in this analysis was to loop over every column to rename it, which wouldn't be possible with that data structure. Instead, this morning I looked at the API for <a href=\"https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/owl/\">Ocaml's Owl</a> and started writing my own library in Roc. I made a Dataframe type which is an opaque wrapper for a list of series, and a series is a union of a bunch of different series types, and each series is an opaque wrapper around a list and a string for the series' name. I used a Python script to generate each series type. I gave up after trying to write an example app using the library I wrote and getting some compiler errors that I didn't understand.</p>\n<p>Here's the repo for my experiment: <a href=\"https://github.com/Hasnep/roc-dataframes\">https://github.com/Hasnep/roc-dataframes</a></p>",
