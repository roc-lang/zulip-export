Multiline comments are not possible because we want people to be able to use roc programs as scripts, so you can run them with <code>./script.roc</code>, which means all commented out lines need to start with <code>#</code>. Most editors have a shortcut like <code>Ctrl+/</code> on vscode to comment out your whole selection but I'm not sure if your editor will know to use the <code>#</code> when you press the shortcut in a roc file.</p>",
