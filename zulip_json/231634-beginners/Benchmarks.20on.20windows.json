On linux we change the stack size for the cfold benchmark, but I don't think that can be done easily on windows, I think we have code to skip the cfold benchmark on windows but perhaps something goes wrong there when trying to bench with cargo instead of criterion. I've never seen the list_map failure before. We do intend to run the benchmarks on windows CI as well in the future but I haven't gotten to it yet.</p>",
