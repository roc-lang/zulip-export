I noticed that url that I'm being directed to is <code>https://www.roc-lang.org/examples/cli/Stdin</code> the issue is fixed when i change <code>examples/cli</code> to <code>packages/basic-cli</code>.</p>\n<p>I would've gone and tried to fix the issue, but I don't know if this can be updated or not or where to report this. Either way I would like this issue to be known!</p>",
