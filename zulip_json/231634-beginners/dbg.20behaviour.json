I've been using roc for advent of code for a couple days now, I am very impressed with the language and its features, however I haven't been able to use <code>dbg</code> correctly, sometimes it either panics the compiler or prints stuff that is not correct. For example, this code from the tutorial panics </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>app &quot;hello&quot;\n    packages { pf: &quot;https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/releases/download/0.1.1/zAoiC9xtQPHywYk350_b7ust04BmWLW00sjb9ZPtSQk.tar.br&quot;}\n    imports [pf.Stdout]\n    provides [main] to pf\n\ntotal = addAndStringify {birds: 5, iguanas: 7}\n\nmain =\n    Stdout.line &quot;There are \\(total) animals.&quot;\n\naddAndStringify = \\counts -&gt;\n    dbg counts\n    num1 = counts.birds\n    num2 = counts.iguanas\n\n    sum = num1 + num2\n    if sum == 0     then &quot;&quot;\n    else if sum &lt; 0 then &quot;negative&quot;\n    else Num.toStr sum\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>It seems that I might not understand how dbg fully works, my current assumption is that dbg somehow \"consumes\" the value and then can not be used after. Any tips on how to use dbg effectivelly?</p>",
