These were installed, but they were installed under <code>/usr/lib64/</code>, which <code>roc</code> wasn't checking in.  foolishly, i wrote a patch to reconcile this before reading the <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> and finding out that first time contributors have to talk to an existing contributor before making their first PR.  In light of this, I absolutely understand if I need to throw away or majorly rework my change, and take full responsibility for that</p>",
