Would go over the pieces of a platform, how they fit together, and how they are built. Would be looking at an existing platform and maybe modify it a tiny bit.</p>\n<p><span aria-label=\"two\" class=\"emoji emoji-0032-20e3\" role=\"img\" title=\"two\">:two:</span>  A sessions where I recreate a platform that already exists. Would be able to focus heavily on explaining due to not creating anything new. Would also potentially copy and paste a solid bit of functionality instead of live coding it (to make it go smoother/faster).</p>\n<p><span aria-label=\"three\" class=\"emoji emoji-0033-20e3\" role=\"img\" title=\"three\">:three:</span>  A session where I more focus on platform modification. I would start with an existing platform, go over some explanation and then dive into expanding the platform to contain an extra feature.</p>\n<p><span aria-label=\"four\" class=\"emoji emoji-0034-20e3\" role=\"img\" title=\"four\">:four:</span>  A totally new platform. I would really be live coding a lot and figuring things out as I go. Might hit some road bumps. Overall, would be more raw platform dev. Get to see the entire process and hopefully I still do a good job of explaining everything. This option could lead to just staring at a segfault for a long time only to realize I did something really silly.</p>\n<p><span aria-label=\"five\" class=\"emoji emoji-0035-20e3\" role=\"img\" title=\"five\">:five:</span> Other, leave a comment below.</p>",
