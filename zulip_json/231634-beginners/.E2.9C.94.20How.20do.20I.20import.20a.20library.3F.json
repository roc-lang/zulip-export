I've looked at some examples, and now have the following in my <code>main.roc</code> file:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>package &quot;rvn&quot;\n    exposes [Rvn]\n    packages {\n        unicode: &quot;https://github.com/roc-lang/unicode/archive/09f22e6aee3adedc2b5cf45f654956b41c157202.tar.br&quot;,\n    }\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>In another module I'm doing this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>interface Rvn\n    exposes []\n    imports [\n        unicode.CodePoint,\n    ]\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>When I now try to run <code>roc build</code> or <code>roc test</code>, something is happening because my fans start spinning and I see a single CPU core go to 100%. I cloned the unicode repo and ran <code>roc build</code> in it for comparison, and that completes within a second. Other than that I'm not seeing any output from the command. I've let it run for a couple of minutes, then killed it. Should I just be a bit more patient, or am I making a mistake?</p>\n<p>I've also tried the <code>json</code> package, but the same thing happens.</p>",
