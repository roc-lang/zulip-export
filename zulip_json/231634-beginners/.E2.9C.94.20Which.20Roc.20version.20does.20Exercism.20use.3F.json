Exercism does <strong>not</strong> automatically rebuild the images regularly: this explains why the roc compiler was getting a bit old on the website. The last time I pushed a change was yesterday, so it should be up to date now, but before that the last change was ~2 weeks ago (and before that it was roughly every week or two).<br>\nIt's probably possible to schedule automatic builds on GitHub Actions, perhaps daily. Anyone know how to do that?<br>\nAlso, you can check the current roc-test-runner image version on the <a href=\"https://exercism.org/tracks/roc/build\">Roc track's build page</a> (scroll down to the Test Runner section).<br>\nThen you can look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/exercism/roc-test-runner/actions\">roc-test-runner repo's latest GitHub actions</a> to find when the latest image was deployed.</p>",
