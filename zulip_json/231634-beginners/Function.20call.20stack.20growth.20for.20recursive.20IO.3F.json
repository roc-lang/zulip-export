In order to capture and maintain some state, I need to pass a function to the platform API to handle inputs, and then I need that function to call the same platform API, passing a call to itself inside a closure with the updated state. At least this is my understanding. Please correct me if I’m wrong.</p>\n<p>Given this fact, should I be worried about the function call stack growing indefinitely and potentially crashing the program? Is there some kind of optimization for that? Or is there another way to handle persistent state without writing to a file/database?</p>",
