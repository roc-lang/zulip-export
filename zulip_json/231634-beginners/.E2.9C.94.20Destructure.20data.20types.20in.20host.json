        "content": "<p>Hi,<br>\nI'm still trying to wrap my mind around writing platforms. One thing I really want to do is to require the roc main to not just return String, but, say, <code>MyType : { x: U8, y: U8 }</code>. As a rust beginner I was a bit blown away by the rust platform example, so I'm sticking to the c-platform for now. Naively I would want to just make a struct <code>struct MyStruct { int x; int y }</code>.  Then change the mainForHost line a bit:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>extern void roc__mainForHost_1_exposed_generic(struct MyStruct *string);\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>and then write in the main</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>struct MyCType r;\n  roc__mainForHost_1_exposed_generic(&amp;r);\n\n  int x = r.x;\n  int y = r.y;\n\n  int sum = x + y;\n  printf(&quot;%d + %d = %d\\n&quot;, x, y, sum);\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>However this seems to be a bit too naive as it does not work :D Could someone maybe explain to me the basics of how to transport such data from roc?</p>",
