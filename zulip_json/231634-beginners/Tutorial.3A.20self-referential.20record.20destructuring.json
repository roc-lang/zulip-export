Str.concat \"A table called \" title }</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus we have a  destructured record in which the default value for the optional <code>description</code> field references the value of the <code>title</code> field of the same record.</p>\n<p>To test this out, I wrote a short program to use this record, but get an error message on run, which tells me that  <code>The #UserApp module does not expose anything by the name title.</code> </p>\n<p>My code is the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>app &quot;records&quot;\n    packages { pf: &quot;https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/releases/download/0.7.1/Icc3xJoIixF3hCcfXrDwLCu4wQHtNdPyoJkEbkgIElA.tar.br&quot; }\n    imports [pf.Stdout]\n    provides [main] to pf\n\nmain =\n    Stdout.line (tableDesc { height: 10, width: 20 })\n\ntableDesc =\\{\n        height,\n        width,\n        title ? &quot;My Table&quot;,\n        description ?

It would appear that the self-referential destructuring functionality is currently broken.</p>",
