Here is a link to the Draft PR  <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/pull/4493\">#4493</a>. My goal isn't to merge this into main, although I'm happy to if this is useful and others might want to extend. I have been using this to learn more about Roc platform dev, and explore ideas for the editor.</p>\n<p>I would appreciate any reviews or recommendations for how to improve this, as I'm pretty new to rust and Roc platform dev. I am particularly interested in feedback on how to do async rust and the event loop properly. Eventually I would like to support Action-State more fully. At the moment the loop should be pretty much instant for any events, with the ui drawn every tick (50ms). The Paragraph and Layout widgets are pretty much 95% supported, although I've only really tested it manually.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/22008/xGcV5gn9Rl1hdSMQxdeDkJF5/Screen-Shot-2022-11-09-at-18.05.17.png\">Screen-Shot-2022-11-09-at-18.05.17.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/22008/xGcV5gn9Rl1hdSMQxdeDkJF5/Screen-Shot-2022-11-09-at-18.05.17.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2022-11-09-at-18.05.17.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/22008/xGcV5gn9Rl1hdSMQxdeDkJF5/Screen-Shot-2022-11-09-at-18.05.17.png\"></a></div>",
