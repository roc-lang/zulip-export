        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"688891\">@Dustin</span> </p>\n<p>I added a very basic configuration for roc to nvim-lspconfig. Assuming you’re using nvim-lspconfig already and it’s up to date you just have to add <code>require'lspconfig'.roc_ls.setup{}</code> to your config and it should work just fine. The language server comes with the Roc installation. So you probably have it installed already. </p>\n<p>nvim-lspconfig: <a href=\"https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#roc_ls\">https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#roc_ls</a></p>\n<p>As mentioned before there’s a treesitter grammar available as well. You can install it with <code>:TSInstall roc</code></p>\n<p>Hope that helps. Have fun <span aria-label=\"blush\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f60a\" role=\"img\" title=\"blush\">:blush:</span></p>",
