That platform can be written in anything that can speak C FFI. So platforms are a form of FFI. They are just really restricted. If you use the roc-wasm4 platform, you can't send a web request. You can't print to the console except for debug logging. You have extreme limitation. As a roc app, there is no escape hatch. You are just stuck with the limitations that the platform exposes.</p>\n<p>When folks ask if roc has FFI, they generally are thinking of python style C FFI. At any point in a python app, I can call any C code that I want. It is completely unrestricted. Roc does not have this form of FFI. So I think it is best to say that roc does not have FFI. Otherwise you just confuse folks.</p>",
