This <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/lukewilliamboswell/9a985c10c2051043bfd9f8413eb8b944\">gist</a> is one experiment to get the size of the current window, and shows my current problem.</p>\n<p>It works well, however it requires a newline input from the user to send the buffered bytes as the terminal is not in raw mode. I'm hoping someone might be able to help or have some insight here. Basically, is it possible to put a terminal into raw mode (so that bytes are not buffered) just by sending bytes down the line, or is that only possible within the platform using a library like <code>termios</code> or <code>rustyline</code>?</p>",
