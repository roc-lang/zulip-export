I was kinda thinking a hash array mapped trie (HAMT) might be the right approach, but that's a difficult thing to implement in Roc.</p>\n<p>So...</p>\n<p>Maybe I could just borrow a HAMT off the shelf from the host language?  I was wondering how difficult it would be to simply fork and extend the platform.</p>\n<p>Obviously I'm not at that point yet. Not even close. I would need to do some performance testing before that becomes a real concern. But it just got me thinking about the possibilities. Has anyone here ever done something like that?</p>",
