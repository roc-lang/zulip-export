Specifically, I want to pre-feed it some context and then evaluate a few expressions. The pre-fed context would be different for each Roc REPL instance. Do you think that’s possible?</p>\n<p>Also, I wanted to check if it would be okay to use the colors from your website in my presentation?</p>",

Also in case you didn't know, we have a standalone repl page at <a href=\"https://www.roc-lang.org/repl\">https://www.roc-lang.org/repl</a> . That may be a good starting point for you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want to pre-feed it some context</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The simplest way to do this may be through (vanilla) js, sending several roc expression through the text area after the page has loaded.</p>",
