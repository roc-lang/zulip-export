Hopefully it will be helpful to others as well.</p>\n<p>To kick things off: is it possible to export a host function from a file other than the main host? It would be nice to have a separation between the necessary low-level functions like <code>roc_alloc</code> and the effects written by platform author.</p>\n<p>Right now, I'm trying in Rust, based on the CLI platform: I create an <code>effects.rs</code> module alongside <code>lib.rs</code>, move the <code>roc_fx_getLine</code> and <code>roc_fx_putLine</code> there and add <code>mod effects</code> to <code>lib.rs</code>. The example fails with a <code>ld</code> error:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>ld: /tmp/roc_appDgDJun.o: in function `roc_fx_getLine_fastcc_wrapper&#39;:\nbuiltins-host:(.text+0x1765): undefined reference to `roc_fx_getLine&#39;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I think the functions are exported on the Rust side: if I leave the original functions in <code>lib.rs</code>, the Rust compiler tells me there's a name conflict. However, I inspected the symbols of <code>host.o</code> with <code>readelf</code> and could not find <code>roc_fx_getLine</code> when I moved it into a separate module.</p>\n<p>I'm no expert on the Rust build process, so I may be doing something incorrectly there!</p>\n<p>The same question would also be interesting for C &amp; Zig hosts</p>",

Essential rust is building a static lib. We are building an object file that depends on the lib. It is failing when we try to link.

Will there be a way to avoid doing this?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think that we should be able to modify the drop function and some ownership pieces to fix this, but I am not completely sure. With the current setup, rust thinks that it is taking ownership of the string we past in while roc thinks that it still has ownership. Either we need to increase the refcount before calling a rust function, or we need rust to not think it owns (and needs to free) the data. Should definitely be possible to clean up, but needs to be looked into more. Specifically around ffi and ownership.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>In the False interpreter example,  when the host opens a file, it wants to return a <code>BufReader&lt;File&gt;</code> to Roc code.

For complex types that Roc will never use directly, it is simply cleaner to just pass a pointer around. It also stops roc from messing with the type at all. That being said, if we wanted Roc to be able to mess with the type. it would likely just be passed as a struct/record. I think it will be use case dependent, but the opaque type is really ergonomic when done right.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>What is the <code>fx</code> keyword in Roc code exactly? Currently, I've seen the use of <code>fx.Effect</code> when defining effects in the host package config, as well as <code>mainForHost : SomeType as Fx</code></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not sure I have a good answer. It is our type for managing side effects and purity. Basically it wraps host related interactions to ensure purity in Roc. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"281383\">@Richard Feldman</span> or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"281543\">@Folkert de Vries</span>  might have a vetter technical answer to this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>What does the first pair of braces stand for in the <code>requires</code> line in <code>Package-Config.roc</code>?<br>\nIn the only example I've found where it's used (benchmarks example), the generated mainForHost has a different name <code>roc__mainForHost_1_exposed_generic</code> - is that related?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Don't know.

Exactly what Roc sees internally can be used externally. So I guess I was just trying to point out that this is a per language api question rather than a Roc design question.

Though would probably swap out C for C++ (personal preference and more automatic memory management). I overall think that it won't be too complex of a task to make these apis and make them function ergonomically.
