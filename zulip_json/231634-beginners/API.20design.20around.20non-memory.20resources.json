        "content": "<p>Let's say I'm designing an API for a platform, and my platform offers access to the file system. Most commonly, we would have two functions:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>readFile : Path -&gt; Task (List U8) FileError\nwriteFile : Path, List U8 -&gt; Task {} FileError\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is great. It is safe, easy and enough for many users.</p>\n<p>However, there are use cases when it is not enough. A file may be too big to fit into memory. Or it may be a zip or other kind of archive, and I just want to read the index and maybe parts of the content depending on what the index says, or I may want to patch a few bytes from a very big file without having to load it all to memory, write to it in memory and then write back everything again, which would be very wasteful.</p>\n<p>These sort of things are usually achieved through APIs like <code>fopen</code> in the C standard library, where you get a file handle, you work on that file handle and then you free it (<code>fclose</code>) when you are done. This lets the programmer do much more granular operations on a file than a path based API, but also poses a new problem: the file handle needs to be freed when it is not used anymore.</p>\n<p>Languages like C++ and Rust solve this by encapsulating the resource in a class with a destructor or <code>Drop</code> trait that will automatically run cleanup code when the object goes out of scope. Roc manages memory automatically, but as far as I know (please do correct me if I am wrong) doesn't let the user write arbitrary cleanup procedures.</p>\n<p>Which takes me back to the original question. What would be the idiomatic way of designing an API in Roc for such a task? I would very strongly prefer if manual <code>fclose</code> was not the answer, because it is very error prone, and because statically ensuring no leaks is a solved problem since Bjarne Stroustrup made C with classes in 1980, so Roc should be able to be at least as good.</p>\n<p>The best I can think for now is a function that takes another function as a parameter, and this inner function is the only one that will ever have access to the file handle. This way we can open the file, call the user function, close the file, and the handle is never risked to be leaked. This is a common pattern in some Rust APIs, such as <code>std::thread::scope</code>, where the thread scope object is only exposed within the user's callback function and never leaks outside.</p>\n<p>So the signature would be something like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>openFile : Path, (FileHandle -&gt; Task a e) -&gt; Task a e\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This would sort of work, I think, but I am not sure that this is the ideal solution.</p>\n<p>I am very interested in what you all think about how you would design such an API.</p>",

This part of the platforms host would be responsible for managing the resources like file descriptors, which I imagine could be represented by an index into a list of handles in the host, and in Roc application is just an Opaque type, so the app never accesses the raw file descriptor. Instead the app creates a Task passes the descriptor back to the platform which in turn unwraps the index and returns that to the host.
