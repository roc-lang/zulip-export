I'm really excited about this language and can't wait to start using it.<br>\nI just have a few questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>pls when will we have an updated roc documentation to start trying out roc (new compiler) and learning the language properly</li>\n<li>pls when is it estimated to get 0.1</li>\n<li>pls what is the idea and model of concurrency in the lang</li>\n</ol>\n<p>thanks soo much</p>",

        "content": "<blockquote>\n<p>pls what is the idea and model of concurrency in the lang</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't have a concise answer to this, but on a very basic level, there are at least 3 ways to think about this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How do asynchronous effects work? The plan here can be summarized as \"asnyc/await without <code>async</code> or <code>await</code>\" - so, like Go and Erlang, you can just write <code>Http.get!(...)</code> and the I/O will automatically be nonblocking async at runtime, no need for the language to have <code>async</code> or <code>await</code> keywords. It will be up to platforms to implement that, and some platforms (e.g. a wasm plugin or something) may choose to make these actually blocking as an implementation detail. The ones that make it nonblocking will use cooperative green threads behind the scenes; <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"343810\">@Brendan Hansknecht</span> already made a proof of concept of this.</li>\n<li>How does concurrency work for effects that aren't I/O? The plan for 0.1.0 is to let platform authors offer primitives and we can experiment to find out what feels nice. For example, Rust Channels can be implemented in any Roc platform right now, with effectful functions for their operations.</li>\n<li>How does concurrency work for pure functions? e.g. can I do \"run <code>map</code> over this <code>List</code> and parallelize each of the transformation function calls\" and if so, how? This is different from concurrency with effects because it requires changes to the stdlib. The answer to this is that I'm intentionally leaving this out of scope for 0.1.0 and planning to revisit it later based on what there turns out to be demand for in practice.</li>\n</ol>",
