Using yesterday's build, the compiler panics at <code>crates/compiler/load_internal/src/file.rs:4903:29</code>. I know adding a built in Sort ability is in the roadmap, but has been deferred due to the thorny problem of local aware string sorting. In the mean time, I figured I could define my own.</p>",

At the risk of side tracking this thread, I read the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/304641-ideas/topic/ordering.2Fsorting.20ability/near/395539545\">thread</a> related to adding Sort. I would think it would be ok to make Sort and not define it for string. While I have no idea how to solve the problem properly for strings, I was thinking in the meantime I could wrap my strings in an Opaque that fits the context of the strings, and then use a fitting sort, e.g. lexicographic or semver.</p>",
