I read that Zig should produce the smallest possible WASM bundle. I didn't find any example of a Zig WASM platform. I found some Rust WASM platforms (joy, galena), but so far I wasn't able to modify them for my use case. So, is there maybe some example I missed? And is my assumption about Zig being the best choice correct? Thanks!</p>",
