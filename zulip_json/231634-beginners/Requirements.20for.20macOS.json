I didn't install from Homebrew but am able to do some basic stuff with the <code>roc</code> command (e.g. get the version, run the REPL, build and run the initial application).</p>\n<p>I have Xcode and the command line tools for that installed so is that the reason? Or will I run into a problem once I start doing more advanced stuff?</p>",
