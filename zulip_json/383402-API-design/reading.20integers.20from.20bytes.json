        "content": "<p>The current <a href=\"https://www.roc-lang.org/builtins/Num#bytesToU16\"><code>Num.bytesToU16</code></a> (and similar) functions don't take <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness\">endianness</a> into account, which means they'll give different answers on different CPUs. We've been eliminating those scenarios, and this seems like one worth eliminating too.</p>\n<p>More broadly, I recently realized that adding things to <code>Num</code> which rely on endianness (like <code>bytesToU16</code> and similar) was probably premature. I think they should be removed for now and revisited later in the context of specific concrete use cases.</p>\n<p>For example, binary serialization formats necessarily specify things like endianness as part of the format, so it's not clear to me how helpful dedicated <code>Num</code> builtins for translating between bytes and certain integer sizes would be in practice.</p>\n<p>I don't think this would block anything from being built in Roc. Consider Zig's <a href=\"https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/993a83081a975464d1201597cf6f4cb7f6735284/lib/std/mem.zig#L1574\"><code>std.mem.readVarPackedInt</code></a>. It supports decoding bit offsets, and does everything in userspace using (as far as I can see) operations that are available in <code>Num</code> in Roc. If a function like that is implementable in userspace, I think all the relevant use cases should be unblocked here.</p>\n<p>Obviously in the future we can revisit this if specific use cases come up which justify builtins, but I think in this case it's worth the forcing function of starting with userspace and seeing what that experience is like in practice.</p>",
