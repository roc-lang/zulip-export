As Johan points out that's not always going to match the user's expectations. </p>\n<p>I think we've reached a point where I need to experiment with some options and see which ones make the most readable roc code, but I thought I'd bring the discussion over here to give people with different perspectives/backgrounds a chance to chime in. In particular I'm interested in advice from people with data science or array programming experience, since I have done very little of either!</p>",

I think generally <code>y</code> is the rows and <code>x</code> is the columns, so you index like this: <code>array[y][x]</code>. But that can differ between use-cases (table with records vs an image) and libraries. I think row and column would clear that up,  but then you still need to remember which one is the \"outer\" one (this is often important for performance)</p>",

If you load a table from a csv file it's pretty unambiguous, but in other cases not so much. If you transpose an image, rows are now columns and columns are now rows, but they're still arrays of pixels. When you render an image to screen, you have a \"contract\" with the library/API/whatever that inner arrays will go horizontally. But it's not a \"property\" of the data.<br>\nBut maybe that's too philosophical/abstract and not productive <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span></p>",
