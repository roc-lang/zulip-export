I was watching Richard's \"Introduction to Roc Programming Language\", and the http error (on the client side) is nothing short of impressive. However, coming from Elm decoders, I found it super strange that the HttpDecodingFailed does not have a payload with the actual error \"Expected to find a string with name 'message'\" or something. I am sure there is some technical decision/limitation behind this. I tried searching Zulip for \"HttpDecodingFailed\" but I didn't get a single hit (<span aria-label=\"interrobang\" class=\"emoji emoji-2049\" role=\"img\" title=\"interrobang\">:interrobang:</span>), so that is why I am asking here if the reason for the lack of payload is due to a technical limitation, of if this is something that has been planned for future versions of the API.</p>",
