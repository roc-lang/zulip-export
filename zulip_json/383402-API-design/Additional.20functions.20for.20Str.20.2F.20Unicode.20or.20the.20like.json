Looking through e.g. Str I found a few things I'd eventually miss, but didn't know if they're just not added yet, or if that's something not yet fully discussed. Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>padStart (Repeat a pattern / character / fillString at the start of a string until a specified maximum length is reached, see e.g. also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_left-pad_incident\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_left-pad_incident</a>)</li>\n<li>padEnd (Repeat a pattern / character / fillString at the end of a string until a specified maximum length is reached, see e.g. also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_left-pad_incident\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_left-pad_incident</a>)</li>\n<li>isEmpty / isNonEmpty (unless that's supposed to be checked against e.g. an empty string \"manually\")</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the package concerned with capitalization and the like (which I think is referred to in the docs to being somewhere else) eventually - though likely not a to high priority:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>capitalize</li>\n<li>uncapitalize</li>\n<li>toUpperCase</li>\n<li>toLowerCase</li>\n<li>camelToSnake (given that snake case is apparently the preferred style)</li>\n<li>kebabToSnake</li>\n<li>pascalToSnake</li>\n<li>snakeToCamel</li>\n<li>snakeToKebab</li>\n<li>snakeToPascal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>P.s.: I assume that len is for length, which then <a href=\"https://www.roc-lang.org/builtins/alpha4/Str/#len\">https://www.roc-lang.org/builtins/alpha4/Str/#len</a> right now in the current docs likely still has some placeholder (<code>len : Str -&gt; [LearnAboutStringsInRoc Str]</code> A stub function to help people discover <a href=\"https://www.roc-lang.org/faq.html#strings-in-roc\">how they should handle this in Roc</a>.)</p>",
