Below is an example of how I implemented the change cursor position with ANSI escapes. I'm assuming here that the terminal supports ANSI escapes. Maybe this is a similar story for unicode, where the platform makes no assumptions and the app developer is free to implement whatever suits their use-case.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>cursorPosition : {row: I32, col: I32} -&gt; Str\ncursorPosition = \\{row, col} -&gt;\n    rowStr = row |&gt; Num.toStr\n    colStr = col |&gt; Num.toStr\n\n    &quot;\\u(001b)[\\(rowStr);\\(colStr)H&quot;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I guess some experimentation with ZWJ (emoji) sequences might help to explore the limitations/capabilities of this further.</p>",
