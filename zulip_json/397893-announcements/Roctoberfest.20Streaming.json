The video will be uploaded on youtube afterwards, but I always enjoy it when people join live and ask questions. I personally prefer chatting and teaching to coding live. Side tangents and general programming and contributing discussions are very welcome.</p>\n<p>If you have times that work better for you to view the stream, please add them to: <a href=\"https://www.when2meet.com/?26873285-NDR2w\">https://www.when2meet.com/?26873285-NDR2w</a> My potential streaming times should say \"Streamer - Brendan\" is available. I'll also probably stream a few more times over the month, but no concrete plans yet.</p>\n<p>I'll later announce the time I'll go live. Could be as soon as tomorrow evening PST. I'll be live at <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/bhansconnect\">https://www.twitch.tv/bhansconnect</a> (feel free to follow now). And the youtube video will later be uploaded to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bhansconnect\">https://www.youtube.com/@bhansconnect</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you have any topics you would like me to go over, general questions, etc. Please drop them below or dm me directly. I want to firstly make this useful to all of you. Otherwise, I think I have a defacto issue in the Roc codebase that I will work on (no idea how easy or hard it will be, but definitely will involve learning).</p>",

Come ask any question you have about roc, contributing, etc or just hang out.</p>\n<p>After general discussion and question answering, I plan to attempt to work on fixing a bug in  how we handle importing functions from the application to the platform. If that goes well, may even start looking into exposing multiple functions from the platform to the host. Two long standing issues that have irked me, but are in parts of the compiler that I really don't know. So will be a lot of exploration and debugging.</p>",
