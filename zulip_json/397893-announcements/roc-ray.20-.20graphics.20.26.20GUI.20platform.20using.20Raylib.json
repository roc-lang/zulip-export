I'm hoping others may find this helpful or be interested to add more functionality. It's a great way to learn more about zig and platform development.</p>\n<p>Basically, I updated to use a nix flake so it's easier to get the correct roc and zig dependencies.</p>\n<p>I also upgraded to use a newer zig library for bindings to raylib and raygui which are much simpler and now support zig 0.13.0. This is a major simplification with these dependencies. </p>\n<p>I also updated the CI so it's easier to check everything in GH PR's.</p>\n<p>Thank you to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"481285\">@Jared Cone</span> for help with updating the roc code to the latest features like Task as builtin etc. </p>\n<p>If there is demand for it, we can probably also make a URL release which would also make it easier to use for application authors.</p>\n<p>There's a lot more we can do here, but now it should be much easier for people to get up and running. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/22008/5bmi5cmVAuMjetsveXmm_9na/roc-ray-2.gif\">roc-ray-2.gif</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/22008/5bmi5cmVAuMjetsveXmm_9na/roc-ray-2.gif\" title=\"roc-ray-2.gif\"><img data-animated=\"true\" data-original-dimensions=\"982x734\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/22008/5bmi5cmVAuMjetsveXmm_9na/roc-ray-2.gif/840x560-anim.webp\"></a></div>",
