It is based on gleam's web framework wisp.<br>\nI like to play around with roc to see what you can build from its minimal design. It's really cool what you can do with it.<br>\nOnce I saw the wisp web framework and how it uses the <code>use</code> expression in gleam, I knew there could be a similar library in roc with backpassing. Since I'm a student with exams coming up, I don't have much time to work on it, but I do think this api has potential. Especially the middleware api with backpassing</p>",
