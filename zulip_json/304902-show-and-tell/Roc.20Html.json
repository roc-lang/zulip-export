If I understand right, sanitization assumes that you <em>want</em> to display HTML written by the user, so it renders that HTML safely by removing unsafe elements and attributes and stuff. Escaping just means making sure it renders as text instead of HTML. (See <a href=\"https://web.dev/sanitizer/#the-difference-between-escaping-and-sanitizing\">https://web.dev/sanitizer/#the-difference-between-escaping-and-sanitizing</a>.)</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>sanitize(&#39;&lt;em&gt;hello world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; onerror=alert(0)&gt;&#39;) == &#39;&lt;em&gt;hello world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot;&gt;&#39;\nescape(&#39;&lt;em&gt;hello world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; onerror=alert(0)&gt;&#39;) == &#39;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;hello world&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&#39;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I think escaping is what we want most of the time anyway for text nodes, and it's much simpler, safer, and presumably faster. I've been reading about escaping today and looking at web frameworks in a few different languages. It seems like all escaping requires is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace all <code>'</code>s with <code>&amp;#39;</code></li>\n<li>Replace all <code>&amp;</code>s with <code>&amp;amp;</code></li>\n<li>Replace all <code>\"</code>s with <code>&amp;quot;</code></li>\n<li>Replace all <code>&lt;</code>s with <code>&amp;lt;</code></li>\n<li>Replace all <code>&gt;</code>s with <code>&amp;gt;</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The same procedure works for both text nodes and attribute values. The only footgun I've found is that this replacement needs to be done with codepoints, not graphemes. The string <code>something؀&lt;h1&gt;͏bad؀&lt;/h1&gt;͏something</code> contains the codepoint for <code>&lt;</code>, but it doesn't include <code>&lt;</code> as a grapheme because it's combined with a combining character. The browser still considers that string to have an HTML tag, so it's presumably important to do the replacement at the codepoint level. (Due to the way UTF-8 works, the bytes for <code>'</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>\"</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, and <code>&gt;</code> can never appear as a byte inside a larger codepoint, so just looking at the byte level works too.)</p>\n<p>I think I have the escaping working in roc-html, and I created an opaque type <code>SafeStr</code> to make it harder to mess up. I can submit a PR soon if people think that's a good idea.</p>",
