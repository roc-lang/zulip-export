It should work pretty well although I have not tested it rigorously. Right now Lambdas can only be compiled on Linux, but I hope to expand that to MacOS also. I had a lot of fun writing the platform and I hope some folks can enjoy using it too. Please open an issue if you run into any! The platform is written in Rust and uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime\">aws-lambda-rust-runtime</a> under the hood. It is very cool to be able to write lambdas in a language like Roc and still get the excellent startup/runtime performance of the Rust runtime <span aria-label=\"smiley\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f603\" role=\"img\" title=\"smiley\">:smiley:</span></p>",

The downside is that right now it is very slow. I'm not sure why it is so slow, and I'm sure it can be sped up, but I have not yet taken the time to look into what is going on.</p>\n<p>The runtime depends on some unreleased changes in basic-cli so I've included the platform directly, but it can be moved to a url once a new release of basic-cli is out.</p>",
