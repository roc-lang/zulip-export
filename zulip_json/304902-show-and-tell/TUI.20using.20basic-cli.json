This <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/lukewilliamboswell/016a2bc00cf69a012aa8386451ada0c9\">code gist</a> has my progress from today's effort. Basically all it does it draw a small \"game map\" to the screen and take user input from the keyboard. It validates most of the key requirements to build a small game or app using the terminal. Below is a gif which shows how it looks at the moment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/22008/BqkvhGXhjH1UuT4GT-_n1wQ-/tui-example-2.gif\">tui-example-2.gif</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/22008/BqkvhGXhjH1UuT4GT-_n1wQ-/tui-example-2.gif\" title=\"tui-example-2.gif\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/22008/BqkvhGXhjH1UuT4GT-_n1wQ-/tui-example-2.gif\"></a></div><p>I had a go at making something that included the clock to tick the game loop over, but without <code>Task.map2</code> to enable asynchronous IO in the platforms I don't think that is possible RN.</p>",

The ANSI Escapes can get you some functionality, but are very limited and different terminals are wildy inconsistentent with how they support things.
