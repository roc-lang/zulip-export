However, I don't like the varied and semi-arbitrary token groupings used by even the best themes - some try very hard to be logical for most programming languages, some seem to try to use as many palette colors as possible, and no two themes group tokens the same way. I want to switch color themes based on my mood, surroundings, or presentation audience... without my code randomly reading differently as a result.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I decided on a simple set of coloring rules, based on Roc's semantic concepts (because Roc is my primary language today). I'm now 99% delighted with how Roc looks in my editor (Helix)! <span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span> </p>\n<p>Unlike almost every online discussion thread, I welcome bikeshedding on my color choices!
