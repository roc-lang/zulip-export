I've only tested it against my,  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"343810\">@Brendan Hansknecht</span>'s and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"528453\">@Ghislain</span>'s  advent of code  solutions.  So its certainly missing a lot of features compared to the rust cli platform.  </p>\n<p>If you find any bugs or have any ideas / suggestions / requests please post here or create an issue.</p>",
