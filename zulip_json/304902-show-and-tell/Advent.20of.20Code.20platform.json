While Roc is running, there are no allocations. As default, it allocates one GiB of memory, but other sizes can be used via the argument <code>--memory</code>. The platform does not deallocate any memory. Last year, I activated deallocations on day 17, since this was necessary for my solution. It is possible, that I will implement it as well this year. But it will  be optional.</p>\n<p>The output of the platform looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Part1 in 24.141ms, used 64167756 bytes:\n2377\n\nPart2 in 20.347ms, used 64167757 bytes:\n71220\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I think that the platform is a good example for a zig-platform, since it has a working <code>build.zig</code> file, that creates all files necessary for the surgical linker and the legacy linker for linux and mac (I don't have a mac, so I could only test it with linux, but I should work). The platform does not use C-<code>malloc</code> and fiends, but a zig allocator (but without deallocate at the moment).  As soon as <code>expect</code> works like <code>dbg</code> and does not need <code>shm_open</code>, <code>mmap</code> and <code>getppid</code> anymore, it should be possible to use the platform without libc.</p>",
