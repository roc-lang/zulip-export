So this is not possible in Roc. Of course you could use an effect to save state to the host, but that is just this model with extra steps.</p>\n<p>In the future, if roc adds something like <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"304641\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/304641-ideas/topic/.02klzzwxh.3A0000.03.20ability\">#ideas &gt; <code>Stored</code> ability</a>, it would then become possible to keep all of the state on the roc side. Though it would be saved and loaded through tasks. That said, roc understands the types fully, so probably could optimize that use case a bit more (and should avoid all boxing hopefully).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>passing in the previous model and getting the next</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is just a single pointer being passed back and forth. So theoretically no real cost.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, I wonder if this approach is leaving a lot on the table performance-wise?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For wasm4 were models are small, and allocations are a mostly linear array, probably not that much performance lost. For more complex use cases, probably a lot of performance lost.</p>\n<p>That said, all of the real loss is in our current handling of <code>Box</code>. As it stands today, each iteration will take the boxed model, copy it to the stack, free the box, build a new model on the stack, allocate a new box, copy the new model into the box.</p>\n<p>This has 2 core inefficiencies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>extra allocations/deallocations and refcount changes.</li>\n<li>wasting time copying data to/from the stack</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What we really want is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>reading directly from the box without needing to copy the entire struct out</li>\n<li>never changing the refcount of the box cause it will be reused</li>\n<li>writing back to the box at the end without allocating a new one.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This would be the same flow as if we had just passed around a reference to a large struct and then updated it at the end. If we had a smarter compiler and a proper <code>Box.update</code> function, most of this loss should be mitigated.</p>\n<p><del>All that said, I think it should be possible to remove the boxing and allocate a single storage space for the model (actually may take 2 to be safe). Storage would still live on the host, but it could be in an alloca on the stack or allocated on the heap just once. I'll look into doing that to safe from a bit of the extra cost of box.</del> nvm, that isn't doable cause we don't know how the struct will be passed in. That depends on the exact struct implementation details. So have to box currently.</p>",
