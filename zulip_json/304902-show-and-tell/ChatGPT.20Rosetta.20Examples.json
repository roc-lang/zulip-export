        "content": "<h1>ChatGPT writing Roc code</h1>\n<p>I thought I would do some experimentation with ChatGPT and see if I can get it to write Roc code which solves a Rosetta code problem. I've found it to be very close, and is now getting to the point where it provides an almost perfect solution. I have hit the usage limit for today, so thought I would share what I have so far. Here is my <a href=\"https://github.com/lukewilliamboswell/roc-things/tree/main/rosetta\">Rosetta solutions using ChatGPT</a> for anyone who is interested. </p>\n<h2>Initial prompt</h2>\n<p>This is the prompt that I have been using. I'm interested if there are ways to improve this somehow?</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>You are ProgrammerGPT, an expert software developer who enjoys learning new programming languages.\nYou are going to write a solution to a Rosetta code problem using the new Roc programming language.\nFirst I will give you some examples, please respond with just &quot;Ack&quot; after you have read and understood each example.\nI will then give you the task using the format &quot;Task:&quot;. Do you understand?\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Feeding examples</h2>\n<p>I then copy in each of the previous apps (all using CLI platform) in series as follows.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Example 1:\n&#39;&#39;&#39;roc\n&lt;-- INSERT FILE CONTENTS HERE --&gt;\n&#39;&#39;&#39;\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Task with hints</h2>\n<p>I then asked ChatGPT to solve the task using the following. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Task: Write a program that prints the integers from `1` to `100` (inclusive). But:\n- for multiples of three, print Fizz (instead of the number),\n- for multiples of five, print Buzz (instead of the number), and\n- for multiples of both three and five, print FizzBuzz (instead of the number).\n\nYou may find the following Roc functions useful;\n- `Num.powInt : Int a, Int a -&gt; Int a`\n- `Num.mul : Num a, Num a -&gt; Num a`\n- `Num.sub : Num a, Num a -&gt; Num a`\n- `Num.isGt : Num a, Num a -&gt; Bool`\n- `Num.divCeil : Int a, Int a -&gt; Int a`\n- `Num.divTrunc : Int a, Int a -&gt; Int a` Divide two integers, truncating the result towards zero\n- `Num.rem : Int a, Int a -&gt; Int a` Obtain the remainder (truncating modulo) from the division of two integers\n- `Str.joinWith : List Str, Str -&gt; Str` to concatenate `Str` values\n\nNote that Roc uses `Bool.true` and `Bool.false` instead of `True` and `False`, and Roc uses `when ... is` instead of `case .. of`.\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Writing tests</h2>\n<p>Sometimes I have had to prompt for tests and documentation comments for functions using something like the following.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>In Roc you can write documentation comments using `##`.\nAlso you can write a unit test using the `expect` function like `expect 2 + 3 == 5`.\nWrite a documentation comment and some relevant units test for the following function.\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Results.. so far</h2>\n<p>The first and second apps needed a few rounds of feedback, and some major changes to get them to compile with <code>roc check</code>. The third and fourth were both pretty close to perfect on the first try. Both had a some minor issues to resolve manually. These were mostly due to having not being trained on Roc syntax and so it was using Elm or Haskell instead I think.</p>\n<p>It feels likely that with more examples to feed it, or some training, ChatGPT could probably write simple Roc apps without too much trouble. I look forward to trying this again when my usage limit is lifted, and see how close I can get to a working app first try.</p>",

It would be useful to slowly build towards a dataset that can be used in that way. I guess one of the challenges is writing code for a particular platform? Maybe all the examples in a data set should be purely Roc language syntax only, and then have some way to separate out the platform specific code? Or if it is easy enough just try and keep all the examples on the <em>latest</em> cli-platform and re-train if there are any breaking changes.</p>",

Make sure to choose the examples so that a lot of roc syntax is demonstrated. Finally provide the algorithm that you want to create in roc in python and ask to translate it to roc. Experimenting with alternatives to python like elm/haskell/scala may also yield improvements.</p>",

We mostly need a lot of examples of good quality with some tests that ensure correctness of the implementation.</p>",
