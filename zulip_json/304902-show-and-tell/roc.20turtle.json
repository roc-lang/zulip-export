But I don't want to teach my children an outdated language like python.</p>\n<p>So here is the <a href=\"https://github.com/ostcar/roc-turtle\">roc-turtle</a>-platform.</p>\n<p>Currently, it only supports linux with the surgical linker. I am not sure, if you have to install sdl2 and sdl2_image.</p>\n<p>Here is the example app:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"roc\"><pre><span></span><code>app [main] {\n    pf: platform \"https://github.com/ostcar/roc-turtle/releases/download/v0.0.1/xiStykcN7qK5K0pu3NqrnriaYPPYJ7vtrxBmOjowdkU.tar.br\"\n}\n\nimport pf.Task\nimport pf.Turtle\n\nmain =\n    _ = Turtle.up!\n    _ = Turtle.goto! 0 0\n    _ = Turtle.down!\n    _ = Turtle.goto! 238.834 32.1052\n    _ = Turtle.goto! 372.438 190.101\n    _ = Turtle.goto! 459.665 166.324\n    _ = Turtle.goto! 505 220\n    _ = Turtle.goto! 450 220\n    _ = Turtle.goto! 440.315 263.689\n    _ = Turtle.goto! 264.673 393.424\n    _ = Turtle.goto! 274.527 452.132\n    _ = Turtle.goto! 176.55 530\n    _ = Turtle.goto! 236.751 227.086\n    _ = Turtle.goto! 0 0\n    _ = Turtle.up!\n    Turtle.goto! 100 200\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The final goal would be to switch the zig-sdl2 host for a javascript-canvas-wasm-host to get something like this <a href=\"https://pythonsandbox.com/turtle\">https://pythonsandbox.com/turtle</a> So lets see how the <a href=\"#narrow/stream/316715-contributing/topic/playground.2Frepl.20with.20LSP.20support\">playground with LSP support</a> project goes.</p>",

So if anyone is interested in learning more about platform development or zig, and has an interest then this could be a good project. I'm happy to provide advice or assistance if you need. </p>\n<p>Also, if we implemented a layout algorithm in pure roc it would also be pretty usable GUI platform too.</p>",
