Or possibly to use roc as the scripting or plugin language for an application written with those libraries. machengine is going the direction of an ECS and they have some cool ideas like gkurve which I think might result in really high performance for GUI. The linebender approach is also interesting with the rust community collaborating towards GUIs and also focussing on GPUs.</p>",

In these cases, we intentionally make a choice to write a pure-Zig version instead, even though the initial experience results in less features and capabilities. It is the short-term price we pay to have a better long-term future.</p>\n</blockquote>",
