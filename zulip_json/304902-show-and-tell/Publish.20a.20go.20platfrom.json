You first had to build roc and afterwards go. So the user of the platform had to install and run go to run the roc code.</p>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/pull/6614\">recent change to roc</a>, this is not necessary anymore. Now, it is possible to preprocess a go-platform, as you would preprocess any other platform. The user of the platform does not have to install or run go. He/She can just use the prebuilt-platform, and let the surgical linker combine the go-platform and the roc code.</p>\n<p>A go-platform now behaves the same as any other platform.</p>\n<p>To preprocess a go-platform, you can use the following commands:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Bash\"><pre><span></span><code>roc<span class=\"w\"> </span>build<span class=\"w\"> </span>--lib<span class=\"w\"> </span>path/to/example/main.roc<span class=\"w\"> </span>--output<span class=\"w\"> </span>platform/libapp.so\n<span class=\"nv\">CC</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">\"zig cc\"</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>go<span class=\"w\"> </span>build<span class=\"w\"> </span>-C<span class=\"w\"> </span>platform<span class=\"w\"> </span>-buildmode<span class=\"o\">=</span>pie<span class=\"w\"> </span>-o<span class=\"w\"> </span>dynhost\nroc<span class=\"w\"> </span>preprocess-host<span class=\"w\"> </span>path/to/example/main.roc\nroc<span class=\"w\"> </span>run<span class=\"w\"> </span>--prebuilt-platform<span class=\"w\"> </span>my_app/main.roc\n</code></pre></div>",
