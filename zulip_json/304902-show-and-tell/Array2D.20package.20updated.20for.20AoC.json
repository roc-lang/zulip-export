Hopefully someone will find it useful for advent of code this year and provide feedback :)</p>\n<p>At this point the two main things I'm interested in are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What more data-sciencey folks would look for in a package like this. I used numpy a few times years ago, but otherwise don't have much insight about the domain.</li>\n<li>If it's worthwhile to build this out to include fixed-sized (one-dimensional) arrays, 3D arrays, or n-dimensional arrays. 2D def felt like a sweet spot, would generalizing be good or lead to unnecessary complexity?</li>\n</ul>",
