Thank you Luke!</p>\n<p>The app is a small search experience for one of the real estate agencies in beautiful Stockholm, Sweden. If you're not afraid of Swedish you can try it out here: <a href=\"https://www.bosthlm.se/till-salu\">https://www.bosthlm.se/till-salu</a></p>\n<p>It searches as you type (no debouncing yet, so enjoy a flurry of HTTP requests!) and has \"infinite scroll\". It hits an API written in Ruby, and the next goal is to replace that with Roc.</p>\n<p>You may also enjoy the videos on the website as they've been blessed by Roc as well. Photographers upload raw material to a Roc service, which transcodes it using ffmpeg, sends it over to an editor and blahblahblah - main point: it's Roc!</p>\n<p>Here's the search feature (the teal(?) box and the listings below it are rendered by Roc, not the rest of the page):</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/22008/7j6beXdOAX8Su4Ehf8cbjQGC/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/22008/7j6beXdOAX8Su4Ehf8cbjQGC/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-dimensions=\"2482x2106\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/22008/7j6beXdOAX8Su4Ehf8cbjQGC/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
