I haven't spent much time on it yet, but sharing in case someone has any ideas or feedback. </p>\n<p>I've been wanting to check out <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"489294\">@Agus Zubiaga</span>  roc-pg library, and also test out a vague idea I've been thinking about to make a web server using roc and CGI.</p>\n<p>Basically it's just a golang web server which routes requests to roc <code>basic-cli</code> scripts, passing relevant parameters as environment variables. If I keep going in this direction I imagine working towards <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3875.html#section-3.4\">rfc3875</a> or similar.</p>\n<p>The scripts are compiled into executables when the server loads. Initially I had it running the scripts on each request, but that was much slower on macOS. After changing it to build when server loads using <code>--optimize</code>, it was awesome fast (like single digit micro-seconds fast). Unfortunately with roc-pg <code>--optimize</code> runs a bit too slow.  </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>% bash run.sh\n2023/05/28 20:44:22 INFO: Listening on port 8080\n2023/05/28 20:44:30 GET /todo 354 ms\n2023/05/28 20:44:32 GET /todo/one 324 ms\n2023/05/28 20:44:33 GET /todo 28 ms\n2023/05/28 20:44:36 GET /todo/one 31 ms\n2023/05/28 20:44:38 GET /todo 31 ms\n2023/05/28 20:44:39 GET /todo/one 38 ms\n2023/05/28 20:44:42 GET /todo 27 ms\n</code></pre></div>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/22008/PXWH9iFMAOHvm2GpEBMVS4cx/Screen-Shot-2023-05-28-at-20.58.38.png\">Screen-Shot-2023-05-28-at-20.58.38.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/22008/7Ep94rQdDHXt15ziYrhQIkPb/Screen-Shot-2023-05-28-at-20.58.46.png\">Screen-Shot-2023-05-28-at-20.58.46.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/22008/PXWH9iFMAOHvm2GpEBMVS4cx/Screen-Shot-2023-05-28-at-20.58.38.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-05-28-at-20.58.38.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/22008/PXWH9iFMAOHvm2GpEBMVS4cx/Screen-Shot-2023-05-28-at-20.58.38.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/22008/7Ep94rQdDHXt15ziYrhQIkPb/Screen-Shot-2023-05-28-at-20.58.46.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2023-05-28-at-20.58.46.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/22008/7Ep94rQdDHXt15ziYrhQIkPb/Screen-Shot-2023-05-28-at-20.58.46.png\"></a></div>",
