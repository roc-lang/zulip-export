It contains everything I've managed to learn about the layout of each of the shapes <code>roc glue</code> can pass to a glue plugin. There are still some holes someone else might be able to fill in, either before or after it's merged. I'm hoping this can be of use to anyone else looking to write glue plugins!</p>",
