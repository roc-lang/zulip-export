We can then distribute that with the platform, in <code>roc build --bundle</code> I assume, and then when Roc builds the app the surgical linker can insert the app parts and fix it up so that it works without needing a dynamic library loaded. To do this I think it would also be desirable for platforms to be specify how they are built. I.e. offload the building to <code>build.zig</code> instead of doing that in the Roc cli build pipeline.</p>\n<p>I don't really have a question in here, but just wanted to share.</p>",
