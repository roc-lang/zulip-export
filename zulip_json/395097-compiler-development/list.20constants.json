I assume <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"281543\">@Folkert de Vries</span> you have the most context on this.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts or tips on what it would take to fix this/how large the project is. I would love to get to the point where all lists that don't contain pointers (box, str, list, recursive tag), can be compile time constants. The lists with pointers will still need to wait on fixing some relocation issue in the the surgical linker.</p>",
