The easier ones would be stm32s or esp32s (those are both arm/thumb or risc 5). Mostly should be a little toolchain setup. I also think I want to try to get roc on AVR chips (Arduino). Rust, c, and python all can run on Arduinos. So I bet roc can too. That said, it has more complex constraints, like being 8 bit with 16 or 24 bit pointers, more extreme memory constraints, and a much more early stages llvm pipeline.</p>",
