I noticed we have <code>StringStart</code>, <code>StringEnd</code> and pairs for braces. But <code>SingleQuote</code> doesn't have start/end pair. I assume tokens seq for a valid single quote (e.g. <code>'a'</code>) are expected to be <code>[SingleQuoteStart, StringPart, SingleQuoteEnd]</code> (<code>StringPart</code> in the middle)? wdyt?</p>",
