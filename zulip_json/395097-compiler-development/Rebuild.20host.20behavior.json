I am helping out <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"515757\">@Luke Boswell</span> with the <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/pull/6859\">--build-host flag PR</a>. This PR also cleans up a bunch of logic around enumerating / detecting all the various host and build types the compiler will support. Note the most recent changes can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/compare/main...r-bar:roc:rebuild-platform?expand=1\">here</a>, I cannot push to project branches, sorry.</p>\n<p>I am going through cleaning up the failures with the CLI tests. Luke previously set all these to force recompilation of the host to make them close to parity with the existing behavior. This results a few dominant failure modes that spark questions on what we want the user experience (and compiler dev experience) to be.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>--build-host</code> flag is set and a pre-compiled host already exists. Do we wish to:<br>\n  a. Silently rebuild and overwrite the compiled host.<br>\n  b. Fail and stop compilation<br>\n  c. Warn and use the compiled host.<br>\n  d. Warn and rebuild and overwrite the compiled host. (effectively current behavior)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tests do not clean up after themselves currently. Some use a host with source within the compiler repo. With the current set of changes since we are trying to lean away from always rebuilding would you prefer:<br>\n  a. If I always rebuild at the start of the test run (happy medium)<br>\n  b. Always use a compiled artifact if it exists (potentially use a stale artifact if it is not manually cleaned between runs, fast)<br>\n  c. Always rebuild at the start of each test (current behavior, slow)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some tests use <code>basic-cli</code> as their platform. With the <code>--build-host</code> in the most recent version of the PR this always results in the compiler exiting with an error message. 2 questions here:<br>\n  a. Do we want the same behavior as \\#1?<br>\n  b. Is it an antipattern to use these external platforms? Do we want to change them? Something feels strange about it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

We've refactored a bit to help set us up for future build pipeline improvements, and possibly sped up the cli tests by only building hosts once per test run and removing the serial restrictions. </p>\n<p>I think there is only one issue remaining -- and I think I know what is going on. We must have broken the plumbing for using valgrind in the <code>-p roc_cli</code> tests. I know exactly where <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/e3d47b386e3cc31913876828f76c6780d552b3ef/crates/cli/tests/cli_run.rs#L218\">the previous implementation was</a>, which we've moved into a <code>cli_utils::helpers::Run</code> builder API, but it must not be correct. </p>\n<p>I'm not set up well for linux development. I have a machine that I can tests on, but it's basically a remote server and I don't normally use an editor from within a shell/ssh session.
