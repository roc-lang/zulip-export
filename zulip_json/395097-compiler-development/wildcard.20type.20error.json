I meant that it's a bit strange that we call it a mismatch. If we say <code>*</code> is compatible with any type, we should not say the types don't match. Because the actual problem is that the type is not specific enough. It seems reasonable to make a separate  error category for the \"not specific enough\" case. It's very different to e.g. a mismatch where you are using a<code>Str</code> type instead of <code>U64</code>.</p>",
