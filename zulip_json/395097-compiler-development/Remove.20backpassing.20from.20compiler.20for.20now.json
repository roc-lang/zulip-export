We have complexity in the form of detecting commas and arrows that would go away if we were to remove this parsing logic. The desugaring logic is <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/8001de54688f909fd47f489287b4301a4dc03528/crates/compiler/can/src/desugar.rs#L737\">pretty simple</a>, so I don't think it's worth keeping, as it'd be simple to reimplement/copy from git history. Would anyone be opposed to ripping it out for now?</p>",
