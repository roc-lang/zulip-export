We want it to really just point to a directory that has all the precompiled stuff we need. This is a package, just in an already extracted folder.</p>\n<p>My thought on changes. I see two main options. One that is more convenient from a user perspective and another that is cleaner overall.</p>\n<p>Option 1, more convenient for users:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Roc no longer compiles a platform with some bespoke intern magical command.</li>\n<li>Roc will still be allowed to build local platforms for convenience, but it will always just be verbatim calling out to a platform specified command.</li>\n<li>The platform also specifies a relative local folder for its output.</li>\n<li>This output folder most look exactly like an extracted roc package.</li>\n<li>Roc will call the specified command verbatim and then use that folder as if it was an extracted downloaded package.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Option 2, cleaner but less convenient:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Roc will never build a platform, ever.</li>\n<li>The platform build must be run as a separate command.</li>\n<li>This will output a local folder that looks just like an extracted downloaded package.</li>\n<li>A roc platform can specify a local folder as it's platform path. If it does, that path will be used the same way a downloaded package would be used.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Option 2 is cleaner and simpler in the compiler, but it means that new users who want to run examples in the <code>examples</code> folder will need to manually compile the platform. So more readme docs and things won't just work with <code>roc example/....roc</code></p>\n<p>Either of these options remove all of our special platform building code and give platforms direct control over their build script. We still would keep the legacy linker and it hacky library includes. (note: we could maybe let the platforms specify extra linker flags that are required for the legacy linker to work)</p>\n<p>Thoughts?</p>",
