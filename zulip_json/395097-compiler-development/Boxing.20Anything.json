Not really sure what binary format to target though.</p>\n<p>Things like <a href=\"https://protobuf.dev/\">protobuf</a> and <a href=\"https://capnproto.org/\">cap'n proto</a> have no type info in the serialized format and require codegen for decode/encode.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://msgpack.org/\">msgpack</a> or maybe <a href=\"https://bsonspec.org/\">bson</a> look reasonable. They have repeated types inline, which is kinda annoying. So a list of 100 strings specifies that each individual element in the list is a string. That said, with both of these, specifying the element type is a single byte. And everything gets built into a single flat buffer. So should be reasonable for perf.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://avro.apache.org/\">apache avro</a> is one of the few things that seems to have out of band types that are sent as metadata. They send the types as json for some reason. I guess it is meant for big data, so parsing a single json to learn you are decoding a <code>List (Str, Int)</code> is no big deal. Then the actual data is densely packed with no type info.</p>\n<p>Anyone have general input on binary formats with type info? I would guess that <code>bson</code> is the most popular simply because it is used with mongo db. That said, <code>msgpack</code> looks a lot cleaner and simpler. But I don't really have much knowledge of the various options in this space.</p>",
