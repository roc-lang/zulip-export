I was wondering if this is an old hack or if it is still used.</p>\n<p>For building zig native hosts on windows with gnu, we use <code>x86_64-windows-gnu</code>. Do we actually run into windows with gnu when calling <code>Triple::host()</code>? I would assume that the host triple is never going to produce windows gnu. Given we have no way to specify the <code>x86_64-windows-gnu</code> triplet from the command line, I would assume that this is not actually possible to hit currently. Is that the case?</p>\n<p>CC: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"515757\">@Luke Boswell</span> or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"281543\">@Folkert de Vries</span> <br>\nI think you two know the most about the windows build.</p>",
