Once that's done, they are no longer memory <strong>addresses</strong>, but rather memory <strong>offsets</strong></li>\n<li>to deserialize on the other side, we start with our freshly-created (but not yet initialized) ModuleEnv's base address, and go through each of those memory <strong>offsets</strong> and add that base address - thereby converting them back into valid pointers (except in the deserialized address space instead)</li>\n</ul>",
