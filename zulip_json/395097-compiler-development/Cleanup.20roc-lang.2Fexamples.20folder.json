On the main Roc repo, If the CI workflow requires the roc command, you execute <code>cargo build --release --bin roc</code> before the CI step that requires it, and next you can add the somedir/target/release/ folder to the PATH. If it's outside the main roc repo, you can curl and decompress the latest nightly, like <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/blob/9fcd5a3fe88a1911ccd56ecf6e5df88c4f16c098/.github/workflows/test_nightly_many_os.yml#L28\">here</a>.</p>",
