It \"aims to provide 70% of the performance of industrial optimizing compilers in 10% of the code.\"</p>\n<p>This raised the general question for me, should languages have 3 compiler backends in the current ecosystem?</p>\n<p>The backends would be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Dev -&gt; Tailored for the specific language and stunningly fast to compile. Hopefully, just good enough perf that the output is usable (though a tiny bit more perf can be nice at times). Assuming something like QBE is a thin enough layer (and thus has fast compile times), it's dev builds could potentially fill this niche for many languages. But that is a big assumption.</li>\n<li>Optimized -&gt; Cranelift/QBE/Tilde Backend. Get 70% to 90% of the performance in significantly less time.</li>\n<li>Really Optimized -&gt; LLVM  to get to 95+% of the performance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note, you could add a 4 here as well, LLVM + LTO + PGO + any other tools.</p>",
