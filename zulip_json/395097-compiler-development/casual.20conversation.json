In a neutral net that I was debugging, I noticed that one ml framework had significantly less accurate results for the neural net as a whole. After digging into the network, I realized that the results deviated the most when reaching a reduction. I originally assumed the framework was cutting corners in reduction in the name of performance. It wasn't. Turns out that the framework actually had the most accurate floating point reductions. So a more numerically accurate floating point reduction made the neural network as a whole noticeably less accurate. Why? The neural net was trained with a less accurate reduction and had optimized the weights for a less accurate reduction.</p>",

I was doing some styling and trying to figure out the best approach to display code snippets on mobile.</p>\n<p>Rewriting the code snippets to have very short line widths is one approach. The thing is, while that means you don't have to scroll horizontally anymore, I think it creates a different flavor of poor readability where even simple expressions need to be broken across multiple lines.</p>\n<p>One approach that I'm wondering if others have tried before (haven't ran into this myself): Suppose code snippets on mobile are replaced with an icon, that when pressed open the snippet full screen, in landscape mode. The user presses the code example, flips their phone, then only needs to scroll vertically.</p>\n<p>In a brief experiment, I get a line width of about 65 characters with reasonble fontsize that way. I believe 50-70 characters or about 10 words per line is considered about ideal for readability of regular text, so if main-body width is around 50-70 characters on a big screen, then 65-character wide examples will look great on the big screen too, at least typographically speaking.</p>\n<p>Plus, if we can have a simple rule like \"code examples should have a max linewidth of 65\", and the result is the code is readable _and_ looks like same across different screen sizes, that creates a pretty nice experience writing code examples, because what-you-see-is-what-you-get.</p>",

Daan Leijen뗩 Extensible records paper is the simplest approach I know of, and is similar to the approach Elm/Roc use. I'll give a short description of the mechanism in Roc, feel free to ask for elaboration if it's confusing or incomplete. The approach for records is to bind a type variable to a record that unifies freely; for example the call<code>(fun r -&gt; r.x) {x: 1, y: 1}</code>맚ypes the function as<code>{x: a}b -&gt; a</code>(where<code>b</code>말s free) and the record as<code>{x: int, y: int}c</code>(where<code>c</code>말s free);<code>{x: a}b ~ {x: int, y: int}c</code>맟ields<code>b = {y: int}d, c = {}d</code>(where<code>d</code>말s fresh).<br>\nThe approach for variants is the dual. That is, an expression<code> `A 1 = `B \"foo\" </code> types the LHS and RHS as<code>[A int]a</code>마nd<code>[B str]b</code>respectively, the constraint<code>[A int]a ~ [B str]b</code>맚hen solves<code>a = [B str]c, b = [A int]c</code>마nd both the LHS and RHS have type<code>[A int, B str]c</code>. However, a function<code>[A, B]a -&gt; {}</code>말s materially different than<code>[A, B] -&gt; {}</code>- if you have a pattern match over the input on the former, you always need a catch-all branch, whereas a pattern match on the latter only needs a branch for<code>A</code>마nd<code>B</code>. To handle this, Roc selectively removes the remaining unbound variable (<code>a</code> in <code>[A, B]a</code> above) depending on the usage pattern of the variable, for example if it is used in an pattern match without a catch-all branch.</p>",

Basically, thresholds are super nebulous and lead to churn and inconveniences. On the other hand, letting someone interested visualize and debug is super powerful. Also, tracking over time is super powerful. I guess I kinda put it in the same bucket as our fuzzing is right now. I don't want it in CI, but I absolutely want it available for someone interested to start improving the compiler more.</li>\n</ol>",
