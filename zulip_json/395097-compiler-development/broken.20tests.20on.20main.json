Did a bisect and it looks like the failures are from an older commit/PR. My guess is that the failures may depend on the specific CI machine and that is why they aren't being hit all the time (or maybe related to caching). We have 4 failing cli_run tests:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>cli_run::hello_world_no_url</code></li>\n<li><code>cli_run::ingested_file</code></li>\n<li><code>cli_run::ingested_file_bytes</code></li>\n<li><code>cli_run::with_env_vars</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, I did a bisect and the failures are from <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/5557\">#5557</a> specifically this commit: <a href=\"https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/commit/ac13ce57c22e618782437b4cbc75012a19b96d4d\">https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/commit/ac13ce57c22e618782437b4cbc75012a19b96d4d</a></p>\n<p>The failures only happen on the linux x86_64. Any ideas?</p>",
