        "content": "<blockquote>\n<p>what does the fuzzer specifically use the code coverage for?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the fuzzing uses a form of code coverage called sanitizer coverage. For the flags that I turn on in llvm, here is essentially what we get:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Every single basic block in the entire code has a single byte counter. Every time the basic block is run the counter is incremented. (Correction: it is for every edge so it is from basic block to basic block pairs technically that get counted)</li>\n<li>The program counter for each of these basic blocks is stored in a table as well (not 100% sure what this gets used for. I think it is mostly a unique key for each fuzzing locating that the fuzz engine can refer to and use to build structures to better understand the flow of the program. In LibFuzzer it looks like they use this to log when new function have been reached by fuzzing).</li>\n<li>On every indirect call a function is first passed to the a special hook function that can record where the call is jumping to (implemented in the fuzz engine).</li>\n<li>For every single <code>cmp</code> instruction and switch statement, the values being compared are passed to a special hook function (implemented by the fuzz engine). Also, the hook function specifically notes if the value is a constant or if 2 variables are being compared. This is great for getting values to test as inputs/parts of inputs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Instead of simply being based on randomness, fuzzers are based on mutation of interesting inputs. Interesting inputs are inputs that explore new coverage paths.</p>\n<p>In the case of go, they don't use most of the instrumentation. They just use the basic block counters (they probably will use more in the future, but they started simple). Their process in the roughest sense is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start with an input from the coordinator (old things from the corpus, seed data, or random if none exists yet)</li>\n<li>Repeatedly mutate the input for x amount of tries.</li>\n<li>If new coverage is found, pass the new input to the coordinator marking it as interesting (they also do minimization here).</li>\n<li>On test failure, report to the user.</li>\n<li>Loop to 1.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The corpus will be regularly minimized such that it only keeps examples that lead to unique coverage paths. Also the individual examples will be minimized to the smallest examples that hit the same coverage. This helps to keep the corpus small and targeted.</p>\n<p>Overall, this leads to keeping around samples that explore more and more of the code while ignore the swaths of random examples that don't manage to explore anything interesting at all.</p>",

A perhaps naive hope on our side was that we could replace our handwritten generators with the fuzzing engine. This was a goal since generators are somewhat arduous to write and can inadvertently introduce our own assumptions about the data. But then of course if our code is written to e.g. work with signed integers but only works for positive integers, and that is not reflected in the type, then the fuzzing engine will quickly generate illegal input data. So a possible lesson is that fuzzing-driven PBT will require more thoughtful design of the datatypes to be fuzzed. Hopefully in a way that is not too limiting.</p>",
