I need to go through and figure out whats trash and what can actually be a PR. It's just that I'm not a very good zig programmer yet and I don't really know the codebase so I'm kind of afraid of wasting people's time with slop</p>\n<p>here's a link to my fork <a href=\"https://github.com/codegod100/roc/tree/dev\">https://github.com/codegod100/roc/tree/dev</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I had opus organize the commits I had into PRs and add snapshots. Hopefully it ended up being something useful</p>",
