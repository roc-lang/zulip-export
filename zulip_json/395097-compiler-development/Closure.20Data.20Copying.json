This can be seen for example with nested <code>Task.await</code> calls, where each nested <code>Task.await</code> is a separate closure. It may be better to force all nested calls to be the same closure type.</p>",

If you indicate in the closure type the name of a symbol that the closure references (which is already done, at least at the type-checking level), you can avoid unpacking and repacking closure sets by instead representing each closure set as a linked list of records. When you need to add new data, append to the linked list. This used to be an approach for closure compilation, though I don't know how popular it is today.</p>",
