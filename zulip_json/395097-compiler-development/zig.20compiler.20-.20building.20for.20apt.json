Debian packages should not make use of these convenience copies unless the included package is explicitly intended to be used in this way. <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source.html#id34\">16</a> If the included code is already in the Debian archive in the form of a library, the Debian packaging should ensure that binary packages reference the libraries already in Debian and the convenience copy is not used. If the included code is not already in Debian, it should be packaged separately as a prerequisite if possible. <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source.html#id35\">17</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source.html#embedded-code-copies\">https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source.html#embedded-code-copies</a></p>",
